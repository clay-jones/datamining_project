To reveal art and\\nconceal the artist is art’s aim. The critic is he who can translate\\ninto another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful\\nthings.\\n\\nThe highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography.\\nThose who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without\\nbeing charming. This is a fault.\\n\\nThose who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the\\ncultivated. For these there is hope. They are the elect to whom\\nbeautiful things mean only beauty.\\n\\nThere is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well\\nwritten, or badly written. That is all.\\n\\nThe nineteenth century dislike of realism is the rage of Caliban seeing\\nhis own face in a glass.\\n\\nThe nineteenth century dislike of romanticism is the rage of Caliban\\nnot seeing his own face in a glass. The moral life of man forms part of\\nthe subject-matter of the artist, but the morality of art consists in\\nthe perfect use of an imperfect medium. No artist desires to prove\\nanything. Even things that are true can be proved. No artist has\\nethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable\\nmannerism of style. No artist is ever morbid. The artist can express\\neverything. Thought and language are to the artist instruments of an\\nart. Vice and virtue are to the artist materials for an art. From the\\npoint of view of form, the type of all the arts is the art of the\\nmusician. From the point of view of feeling, the actor’s craft is the\\ntype. All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the\\nsurface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their\\nperil. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors.\\nDiversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new,\\ncomplex, and vital. When critics disagree, the artist is in accord with\\nhimself. We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he\\ndoes not admire it. The only excuse for making a useless thing is that\\none admires it intensely.\\n\\nAll art is quite useless.\\n\\nOSCAR WILDE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I.\\n\\n\\nThe studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light\\nsummer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden, there came through\\nthe open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate\\nperfume of the pink-flowering thorn.\\n\\nFrom the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he was\\nlying, smoking, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry\\nWotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured\\nblossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to\\nbear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs; and now and then\\nthe fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long\\ntussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window,\\nproducing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and making him think of\\nthose pallid, jade-faced painters of Tokyo who, through the medium of\\nan art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of\\nswiftness and motion. The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their\\nway through the long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous\\ninsistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine,\\nseemed to make the stillness more oppressive. The dim roar of London\\nwas like the bourdon note of a distant organ.\\n\\nIn the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel, stood the\\nfull-length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty,\\nand in front of it, some little distance away, was sitting the artist\\nhimself, Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance some years ago\\ncaused, at the time, such public excitement and gave rise to so many\\nstrange conjectures.\\n\\nAs the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so\\nskilfully mirrored in his art, a smile of pleasure passed across his\\nface, and seemed about to linger there. But he suddenly started up, and\\nclosing his eyes, placed his fingers upon the lids, as though he sought\\nto imprison within his brain some curious dream from which he feared he\\nmight awake.\\n\\n“It is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done,” said\\nLord Henry languidly. “You must certainly send it next year to the\\nGrosvenor. The Academy is too large and too vulgar. Whenever I have\\ngone there, there have been either so many people that I have not been\\nable to see the pictures, which was dreadful, or so many pictures that\\nI have not been able to see the people, which was worse. The Grosvenor\\nis really the only place.”\\n\\n“I don’t think I shall send it anywhere,” he answered, tossing his head\\nback in that odd way that used to make his friends laugh at him at\\nOxford. “No, I won’t send it anywhere.”\\n\\nLord Henry elevated his eyebrows and looked at him in amazement through\\nthe thin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such fanciful whorls\\nfrom his heavy, opium-tainted cigarette. “Not send it anywhere? My dear\\nfellow, why? Have you any reason? What odd chaps you painters are! You\\ndo anything in the world to gain a reputation. As soon as you have one,\\nyou seem to want to throw it away. It is silly of you, for there is\\nonly one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is\\nnot being talked about. A portrait like this would set you far above\\nall the young men in England, and make the old men quite jealous, if\\nold men are ever capable of any emotion.”\\n\\n“I know you will laugh at me,” he replied, “but I really can’t exhibit\\nit. I have put too much of myself into it.”\\n\\nLord Henry stretched himself out on the divan and laughed.\\n\\n“Yes, I knew you would; but it is quite true, all the same.”\\n\\n“Too much of yourself in it! Upon my word, Basil, I didn’t know you\\nwere so vain; and I really can’t see any resemblance between you, with\\nyour rugged strong face and your coal-black hair, and this young\\nAdonis, who looks as if he was made out of ivory and rose-leaves. Why,\\nmy dear Basil, he is a Narcissus, and you—well, of course you have an\\nintellectual expression and all that. But beauty, real beauty, ends\\nwhere an intellectual expression begins. Intellect is in itself a mode\\nof exaggeration, and destroys the harmony of any face. The moment one\\nsits down to think, one becomes all nose, or all forehead, or something\\nhorrid. Look at the successful men in any of the learned professions.\\nHow perfectly hideous they are! Except, of course, in the Church. But\\nthen in the Church they don’t think. A bishop keeps on saying at the\\nage of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen,\\nand as a natural consequence he always looks absolutely delightful.\\nYour mysterious young friend, whose name you have never told me, but\\nwhose picture really fascinates me, never thinks. I feel quite sure of\\nthat. He is some brainless beautiful creature who should be always here\\nin winter when we have no flowers to look at, and always here in summer\\nwhen we want something to chill our intelligence. Don’t flatter\\nyourself, Basil: you are not in the least like him.”\\n\\n“You don’t understand me, Harry,” answered the artist. “Of course I am\\nnot like him. I know that perfectly well. Indeed, I should be sorry to\\nlook like him. You shrug your shoulders? I am telling you the truth.\\nThere is a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction,\\nthe sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the faltering\\nsteps of kings. It is better not to be different from one’s fellows.\\nThe ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world. They can sit\\nat their ease and gape at the play. If they know nothing of victory,\\nthey are at least spared the knowledge of defeat. They live as we all\\nshould live—undisturbed, indifferent, and without disquiet. They\\nneither bring ruin upon others, nor ever receive it from alien hands.\\nYour rank and wealth, Harry; my brains, such as they are—my art,\\nwhatever it may be worth; Dorian Gray’s good looks—we shall all suffer\\nfor what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.”\\n\\n“Dorian Gray? Is that his name?” asked Lord Henry, walking across the\\nstudio towards Basil Hallward.\\n\\n“Yes, that is his name. I didn’t intend to tell it to you.”\\n\\n“But why not?”\\n\\n“Oh, I can’t explain. When I like people immensely, I never tell their\\nnames to any one. It is like surrendering a part of them. I have grown\\nto love secrecy. It seems to be the one thing that can make modern life\\nmysterious or marvellous to us. The commonest thing is delightful if\\none only hides it. When I leave town now I never tell my people where I\\nam going. If I did, I would lose all my pleasure. It is a silly habit,\\nI dare say, but somehow it seems to bring a great deal of romance into\\none’s life. I suppose you think me awfully foolish about it?”\\n\\n“Not at all,” answered Lord Henry, “not at all, my dear Basil. You seem\\nto forget that I am married, and the one charm of marriage is that it\\nmakes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties. I\\nnever know where my wife is, and my wife never knows what I am doing.\\nWhen we meet—we do meet occasionally, when we dine out together, or go\\ndown to the Duke’s—we tell each other the most absurd stories with the\\nmost serious faces. My wife is very good at it—much better, in fact,\\nthan I am. She never gets confused over her dates, and I always do. But\\nwhen she does find me out, she makes no row at all. I sometimes wish\\nshe would; but she merely laughs at me.”\\n\\n“I hate the way you talk about your married life, Harry,” said Basil\\nHallward, strolling towards the door that led into the garden. “I\\nbelieve that you are really a very good husband, but that you are\\nthoroughly ashamed of your own virtues. You are an extraordinary\\nfellow. You never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing.\\nYour cynicism is simply a pose.”\\n\\n“Being natural is simply a pose, and the most irritating pose I know,”\\ncried Lord Henry, laughing; and the two young men went out into the\\ngarden together and ensconced themselves on a long bamboo seat that\\nstood in the shade of a tall laurel bush. The sunlight slipped over the\\npolished leaves. In the grass, white daisies were tremulous.\\n\\nAfter a pause, Lord Henry pulled out his watch. “I am afraid I must be\\ngoing, Basil,” he murmured, “and before I go, I insist on your\\nanswering a question I put to you some time ago.”\\n\\n“What is that?” said the painter, keeping his eyes fixed on the ground.\\n\\n“You know quite well.”\\n\\n“I do not, Harry.”\\n\\n“Well, I will tell you what it is. I want you to explain to me why you\\nwon’t exhibit Dorian Gray’s picture. I want the real reason.”\\n\\n“I told you the real reason.”\\n\\n“No, you did not. You said it was because there was too much of\\nyourself in it. Now, that is childish.”\\n\\n“Harry,” said Basil Hallward, looking him straight in the face, “every\\nportrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not\\nof the sitter. The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. It is\\nnot he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on\\nthe coloured canvas, reveals himself. The reason I will not exhibit\\nthis picture is that I am afraid that I have shown in it the secret of\\nmy own soul.”\\n\\nLord Henry laughed. “And what is that?” he asked.\\n\\n“I will tell you,” said Hallward; but an expression of perplexity came\\nover his face.\\n\\n“I am all expectation, Basil,” continued his companion, glancing at\\nhim.\\n\\n“Oh, there is really very little to tell, Harry,” answered the painter;\\n“and I am afraid you will hardly understand it. Perhaps you will hardly\\nbelieve it.”\\n\\nLord Henry smiled, and leaning down, plucked a pink-petalled daisy from\\nthe grass and examined it. “I am quite sure I shall understand it,” he\\nreplied, gazing intently at the little golden, white-feathered disk,\\n“and as for believing things, I can believe anything, provided that it\\nis quite incredible.”\\n\\nThe wind shook some blossoms from the trees, and the heavy\\nlilac-blooms, with their clustering stars, moved to and fro in the\\nlanguid air. A grasshopper began to chirrup by the wall, and like a\\nblue thread a long thin dragon-fly floated past on its brown gauze\\nwings. Lord Henry felt as if he could hear Basil Hallward’s heart\\nbeating, and wondered what was coming.\\n\\n“The story is simply this,” said the painter after some time. “Two\\nmonths ago I went to a crush at Lady Brandon’s. You know we poor\\nartists have to show ourselves in society from time to time, just to\\nremind the public that we are not savages. With an evening coat and a\\nwhite tie, as you told me once, anybody, even a stock-broker, can gain\\na reputation for being civilized. Well, after I had been in the room\\nabout ten minutes, talking to huge overdressed dowagers and tedious\\nacademicians, I suddenly became conscious that some one was looking at\\nme. I turned half-way round and saw Dorian Gray for the first time.\\nWhen our eyes met, I felt that I was growing pale. A curious sensation\\nof terror came over me. I knew that I had come face to face with some\\none whose mere personality was so fascinating that, if I allowed it to\\ndo so, it would absorb my whole nature, my whole soul, my very art\\nitself. I did not want any external influence in my life. You know\\nyourself, Harry, how independent I am by nature. I have always been my\\nown master; had at least always been so, till I met Dorian Gray.\\nThen—but I don’t know how to explain it to you. Something seemed to\\ntell me that I was on the verge of a terrible crisis in my life. I had\\na strange feeling that fate had in store for me exquisite joys and\\nexquisite sorrows. I grew afraid and turned to quit the room. It was\\nnot conscience that made me do so: it was a sort of cowardice. I take\\nno credit to myself for trying to escape.”\\n\\n“Conscience and cowardice are really the same things, Basil. Conscience\\nis the trade-name of the firm. That is all.”\\n\\n“I don’t believe that, Harry, and I don’t believe you do either.\\nHowever, whatever was my motive—and it may have been pride, for I used\\nto be very proud—I certainly struggled to the door. There, of course, I\\nstumbled against Lady Brandon. ‘You are not going to run away so soon,\\nMr. Hallward?’ she screamed out. You know her curiously shrill voice?”\\n\\n“Yes; she is a peacock in everything but beauty,” said Lord Henry,\\npulling the daisy to bits with his long nervous fingers.\\n\\n“I could not get rid of her. She brought me up to royalties, and people\\nwith stars and garters, and elderly ladies with gigantic tiaras and\\nparrot noses. She spoke of me as her dearest friend. I had only met her\\nonce before, but she took it into her head to lionize me. I believe\\nsome picture of mine had made a great success at the time, at least had\\nbeen chattered about in the penny newspapers, which is the\\nnineteenth-century standard of immortality. Suddenly I found myself\\nface to face with the young man whose personality had so strangely\\nstirred me. We were quite close, almost touching. Our eyes met again.\\nIt was reckless of me, but I asked Lady Brandon to introduce me to him.\\nPerhaps it was not so reckless, after all. It was simply inevitable. We\\nwould have spoken to each other without any introduction. I am sure of\\nthat. Dorian told me so afterwards. He, too, felt that we were destined\\nto know each other.”\\n\\n“And how did Lady Brandon describe this wonderful young man?” asked his\\ncompanion. “I know she goes in for giving a rapid _précis_ of all her\\nguests. I remember her bringing me up to a truculent and red-faced old\\ngentleman covered all over with orders and ribbons, and hissing into my\\near, in a tragic whisper which must have been perfectly audible to\\neverybody in the room, the most astounding details. I simply fled. I\\nlike to find out people for myself. But Lady Brandon treats her guests\\nexactly as an auctioneer treats his goods. She either explains them\\nentirely away, or tells one everything about them except what one wants\\nto know.”\\n\\n“Poor Lady Brandon! You are hard on her, Harry!” said Hallward\\nlistlessly.\\n\\n“My dear fellow, she tried to found a _salon_, and only succeeded in\\nopening a restaurant. How could I admire her? But tell me, what did she\\nsay about Mr. Dorian Gray?”\\n\\n“Oh, something like, ‘Charming boy—poor dear mother and I absolutely\\ninseparable. Quite forget what he does—afraid he—doesn’t do\\nanything—oh, yes, plays the piano—or is it the violin, dear Mr. Gray?’\\nNeither of us could help laughing, and we became friends at once.”\\n\\n“Laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship, and it is far\\nthe best ending for one,” said the young lord, plucking another daisy.\\n\\nHallward shook his head. “You don’t understand what friendship is,\\nHarry,” he murmured—“or what enmity is, for that matter. You like every\\none; that is to say, you are indifferent to every one.”\\n\\n“How horribly unjust of you!” cried Lord Henry, tilting his hat back\\nand looking up at the little clouds that, like ravelled skeins of\\nglossy white silk, were drifting across the hollowed turquoise of the\\nsummer sky. “Yes; horribly unjust of you. I make a great difference\\nbetween people. I choose my friends for their good looks, my\\nacquaintances for their good characters, and my enemies for their good\\nintellects. A man cannot be too careful in the choice of his enemies. I\\nhave not got one who is a fool. They are all men of some intellectual\\npower, and consequently they all appreciate me. Is that very vain of\\nme? I think it is rather vain.”\\n\\n“I should think it was, Harry. But according to your category I must be\\nmerely an acquaintance.”\\n\\n“My dear old Basil, you are much more than an acquaintance.”\\n\\n“And much less than a friend. A sort of brother, I suppose?”\\n\\n“Oh, brothers! I don’t care for brothers. My elder brother won’t die,\\nand my younger brothers seem never to do anything else.”\\n\\n“Harry!” exclaimed Hallward, frowning.\\n\\n“My dear fellow, I am not quite serious. But I can’t help detesting my\\nrelations. I suppose it comes from the fact that none of us can stand\\nother people having the same faults as ourselves. I quite sympathize\\nwith the rage of the English democracy against what they call the vices\\nof the upper orders. The masses feel that drunkenness, stupidity, and\\nimmorality should be their own special property, and that if any one of\\nus makes an ass of himself, he is poaching on their preserves. When\\npoor Southwark got into the divorce court, their indignation was quite\\nmagnificent. And yet I don’t suppose that ten per cent of the\\nproletariat live correctly.”\\n\\n“I don’t agree with a single word that you have said, and, what is\\nmore, Harry, I feel sure you don’t either.”\\n\\nLord Henry stroked his pointed brown beard and tapped the toe of his\\npatent-leather boot with a tasselled ebony cane. “How English you are\\nBasil! That is the second time you have made that observation. If one\\nputs forward an idea to a true Englishman—always a rash thing to do—he\\nnever dreams of considering whether the idea is right or wrong. The\\nonly thing he considers of any importance is whether one believes it\\noneself. Now, the value of an idea has nothing whatsoever to do with\\nthe sincerity of the man who expresses it. Indeed, the probabilities\\nare that the more insincere the man is, the more purely intellectual\\nwill the idea be, as in that case it will not be coloured by either his\\nwants, his desires, or his prejudices. However, I don’t propose to\\ndiscuss politics, sociology, or metaphysics with you. I like persons\\nbetter than principles, and I like persons with no principles better\\nthan anything else in the world. Tell me more about Mr. Dorian Gray.\\nHow often do you see him?”\\n\\n“Every day. I couldn’t be happy if I didn’t see him every day. He is\\nabsolutely necessary to me.”\\n\\n“How extraordinary! I thought you would never care for anything but\\nyour art.”\\n\\n“He is all my art to me now,” said the painter gravely. “I sometimes\\nthink, Harry, that there are only two eras of any importance in the\\nworld’s history. The first is the appearance of a new medium for art,\\nand the second is the appearance of a new personality for art also.\\nWhat the invention of oil-painting was to the Venetians, the face of\\nAntinous was to late Greek sculpture, and the face of Dorian Gray will\\nsome day be to me. It is not merely that I paint from him, draw from\\nhim, sketch from him. Of course, I have done all that. But he is much\\nmore to me than a model or a sitter. I won’t tell you that I am\\ndissatisfied with what I have done of him, or that his beauty is such\\nthat art cannot express it. There is nothing that art cannot express,\\nand I know that the work I have done, since I met Dorian Gray, is good\\nwork, is the best work of my life. But in some curious way—I wonder\\nwill you understand me?—his personality has suggested to me an entirely\\nnew manner in art, an entirely new mode of style. I see things\\ndifferently, I think of them differently. I can now recreate life in a\\nway that was hidden from me before. ‘A dream of form in days of\\nthought’—who is it who says that? I forget; but it is what Dorian Gray\\nhas been to me. The merely visible presence of this lad—for he seems to\\nme little more than a lad, though he is really over twenty—his merely\\nvisible presence—ah! I wonder can you realize all that that means?\\nUnconsciously he defines for me the lines of a fresh school, a school\\nthat is to have in it all the passion of the romantic spirit, all the\\nperfection of the spirit that is Greek. The harmony of soul and\\nbody—how much that is! We in our madness have separated the two, and\\nhave invented a realism that is vulgar, an ideality that is void.\\nHarry! if you only knew what Dorian Gray is to me! You remember that\\nlandscape of mine, for which Agnew offered me such a huge price but\\nwhich I would not part with? It is one of the best things I have ever\\ndone. And why is it so? Because, while I was painting it, Dorian Gray\\nsat beside me. Some subtle influence passed from him to me, and for the\\nfirst time in my life I saw in the plain woodland the wonder I had\\nalways looked for and always missed.”\\n\\n“Basil, this is extraordinary! I must see Dorian Gray.”\\n\\nHallward got up from the seat and walked up and down the garden. After\\nsome time he came back. “Harry,” he said, “Dorian Gray is to me simply\\na motive in art. You might see nothing in him. I see everything in him.\\nHe is never more present in my work than when no image of him is there.\\nHe is a suggestion, as I have said, of a new manner. I find him in the\\ncurves of certain lines, in the loveliness and subtleties of certain\\ncolours. That is all.”\\n\\n“Then why won’t you exhibit his portrait?” asked Lord Henry.\\n\\n“Because, without intending it, I have put into it some expression of\\nall this curious artistic idolatry, of which, of course, I have never\\ncared to speak to him. He knows nothing about it. He shall never know\\nanything about it. But the world might guess it, and I will not bare my\\nsoul to their shallow prying eyes. My heart shall never be put under\\ntheir microscope. There is too much of myself in the thing, Harry—too\\nmuch of myself!”\\n\\n“Poets are not so scrupulous as you are. They know how useful passion\\nis for publication. Nowadays a broken heart will run to many editions.”\\n\\n“I hate them for it,” cried Hallward. “An artist should create\\nbeautiful things, but should put nothing of his own life into them. We\\nlive in an age when men treat art as if it were meant to be a form of\\nautobiography. We have lost the abstract sense of beauty. Some day I\\nwill show the world what it is; and for that reason the world shall\\nnever see my portrait of Dorian Gray.”\\n\\n“I think you are wrong, Basil, but I won’t argue with you. It is only\\nthe intellectually lost who ever argue. Tell me, is Dorian Gray very\\nfond of you?”\\n\\nThe painter considered for a few moments. “He likes me,” he answered\\nafter a pause; “I know he likes me. Of course I flatter him dreadfully.\\nI find a strange pleasure in saying things to him that I know I shall\\nbe sorry for having said. As a rule, he is charming to me, and we sit\\nin the studio and talk of a thousand things. Now and then, however, he\\nis horribly thoughtless, and seems to take a real delight in giving me\\npain. Then I feel, Harry, that I have given away my whole soul to some\\none who treats it as if it were a flower to put in his coat, a bit of\\ndecoration to charm his vanity, an ornament for a summer’s day.”\\n\\n“Days in summer, Basil, are apt to linger,” murmured Lord Henry.\\n“Perhaps you will tire sooner than he will. It is a sad thing to think\\nof, but there is no doubt that genius lasts longer than beauty. That\\naccounts for the fact that we all take such pains to over-educate\\nourselves. In the wild struggle for existence, we want to have\\nsomething that endures, and so we fill our minds with rubbish and\\nfacts, in the silly hope of keeping our place. The thoroughly\\nwell-informed man—that is the modern ideal. And the mind of the\\nthoroughly well-informed man is a dreadful thing. It is like a\\n_bric-à-brac_ shop, all monsters and dust, with everything priced above\\nits proper value. I think you will tire first, all the same. Some day\\nyou will look at your friend, and he will seem to you to be a little\\nout of drawing, or you won’t like his tone of colour, or something. You\\nwill bitterly reproach him in your own heart, and seriously think that\\nhe has behaved very badly to you. The next time he calls, you will be\\nperfectly cold and indifferent. It will be a great pity, for it will\\nalter you. What you have told me is quite a romance, a romance of art\\none might call it, and the worst of having a romance of any kind is\\nthat it leaves one so unromantic.”\\n\\n“Harry, don’t talk like that. As long as I live, the personality of\\nDorian Gray will dominate me. You can’t feel what I feel. You change\\ntoo often.”\\n\\n“Ah, my dear Basil, that is exactly why I can feel it. Those who are\\nfaithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who\\nknow love’s tragedies.” And Lord Henry struck a light on a dainty\\nsilver case and began to smoke a cigarette with a self-conscious and\\nsatisfied air, as if he had summed up the world in a phrase. There was\\na rustle of chirruping sparrows in the green lacquer leaves of the ivy,\\nand the blue cloud-shadows chased themselves across the grass like\\nswallows. How pleasant it was in the garden! And how delightful other\\npeople’s emotions were!—much more delightful than their ideas, it\\nseemed to him. One’s own soul, and the passions of one’s friends—those\\nwere the fascinating things in life. He pictured to himself with silent\\namusement the tedious luncheon that he had missed by staying so long\\nwith Basil Hallward. Had he gone to his aunt’s, he would have been sure\\nto have met Lord Goodbody there, and the whole conversation would have\\nbeen about the feeding of the poor and the necessity for model\\nlodging-houses. Each class would have preached the importance of those\\nvirtues, for whose exercise there was no necessity in their own lives.\\nThe rich would have spoken on the value of thrift, and the idle grown\\neloquent over the dignity of labour. It was charming to have escaped\\nall that! As he thought of his aunt, an idea seemed to strike him. He\\nturned to Hallward and said, “My dear fellow, I have just remembered.”\\n\\n“Remembered what, Harry?”\\n\\n“Where I heard the name of Dorian Gray.”\\n\\n“Where was it?” asked Hallward, with a slight frown.\\n\\n“Don’t look so angry, Basil. It was at my aunt, Lady Agatha’s. She told\\nme she had discovered a wonderful young man who was going to help her\\nin the East End, and that his name was Dorian Gray. I am bound to state\\nthat she never told me he was good-looking. Women have no appreciation\\nof good looks; at least, good women have not. She said that he was very\\nearnest and had a beautiful nature. I at once pictured to myself a\\ncreature with spectacles and lank hair, horribly freckled, and tramping\\nabout on huge feet. I wish I had known it was your friend.”\\n\\n“I am very glad you didn’t, Harry.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“I don’t want you to meet him.”\\n\\n“You don’t want me to meet him?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Mr. Dorian Gray is in the studio, sir,” said the butler, coming into\\nthe garden.\\n\\n“You must introduce me now,” cried Lord Henry, laughing.\\n\\nThe painter turned to his servant, who stood blinking in the sunlight.\\n“Ask Mr. Gray to wait, Parker: I shall be in in a few moments.” The man\\nbowed and went up the walk.\\n\\nThen he looked at Lord Henry. “Dorian Gray is my dearest friend,” he\\nsaid. “He has a simple and a beautiful nature. Your aunt was quite\\nright in what she said of him. Don’t spoil him. Don’t try to influence\\nhim. Your influence would be bad. The world is wide, and has many\\nmarvellous people in it. Don’t take away from me the one person who\\ngives to my art whatever charm it possesses: my life as an artist\\ndepends on him. Mind, Harry, I trust you.” He spoke very slowly, and\\nthe words seemed wrung out of him almost against his will.\\n\\n“What nonsense you talk!” said Lord Henry, smiling, and taking Hallward\\nby the arm, he almost led him into the house.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II.\\n\\n\\nAs they entered they saw Dorian Gray. He was seated at the piano, with\\nhis back to them, turning over the pages of a volume of Schumann’s\\n“Forest Scenes.” “You must lend me these, Basil,” he cried. “I want to\\nlearn them. They are perfectly charming.”\\n\\n“That entirely depends on how you sit to-day, Dorian.”\\n\\n“Oh, I am tired of sitting, and I don’t want a life-sized portrait of\\nmyself,” answered the lad, swinging round on the music-stool in a\\nwilful, petulant manner. When he caught sight of Lord Henry, a faint\\nblush coloured his cheeks for a moment, and he started up. “I beg your\\npardon, Basil, but I didn’t know you had any one with you.”\\n\\n“This is Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian, an old Oxford friend of mine. I\\nhave just been telling him what a capital sitter you were, and now you\\nhave spoiled everything.”\\n\\n“You have not spoiled my pleasure in meeting you, Mr. Gray,” said Lord\\nHenry, stepping forward and extending his hand. “My aunt has often\\nspoken to me about you. You are one of her favourites, and, I am\\nafraid, one of her victims also.”\\n\\n“I am in Lady Agatha’s black books at present,” answered Dorian with a\\nfunny look of penitence. “I promised to go to a club in Whitechapel\\nwith her last Tuesday, and I really forgot all about it. We were to\\nhave played a duet together—three duets, I believe. I don’t know what\\nshe will say to me. I am far too frightened to call.”\\n\\n“Oh, I will make your peace with my aunt. She is quite devoted to you.\\nAnd I don’t think it really matters about your not being there. The\\naudience probably thought it was a duet. When Aunt Agatha sits down to\\nthe piano, she makes quite enough noise for two people.”\\n\\n“That is very horrid to her, and not very nice to me,” answered Dorian,\\nlaughing.\\n\\nLord Henry looked at him. Yes, he was certainly wonderfully handsome,\\nwith his finely curved scarlet lips, his frank blue eyes, his crisp\\ngold hair. There was something in his face that made one trust him at\\nonce. All the candour of youth was there, as well as all youth’s\\npassionate purity. One felt that he had kept himself unspotted from the\\nworld. No wonder Basil Hallward worshipped him.\\n\\n“You are too charming to go in for philanthropy, Mr. Gray—far too\\ncharming.” And Lord Henry flung himself down on the divan and opened\\nhis cigarette-case.\\n\\nThe painter had been busy mixing his colours and getting his brushes\\nready. He was looking worried, and when he heard Lord Henry’s last\\nremark, he glanced at him, hesitated for a moment, and then said,\\n“Harry, I want to finish this picture to-day. Would you think it\\nawfully rude of me if I asked you to go away?”\\n\\nLord Henry smiled and looked at Dorian Gray. “Am I to go, Mr. Gray?” he\\nasked.\\n\\n“Oh, please don’t, Lord Henry. I see that Basil is in one of his sulky\\nmoods, and I can’t bear him when he sulks. Besides, I want you to tell\\nme why I should not go in for philanthropy.”\\n\\n“I don’t know that I shall tell you that, Mr. Gray. It is so tedious a\\nsubject that one would have to talk seriously about it. But I certainly\\nshall not run away, now that you have asked me to stop. You don’t\\nreally mind, Basil, do you? You have often told me that you liked your\\nsitters to have some one to chat to.”\\n\\nHallward bit his lip. “If Dorian wishes it, of course you must stay.\\nDorian’s whims are laws to everybody, except himself.”\\n\\nLord Henry took up his hat and gloves. “You are very pressing, Basil,\\nbut I am afraid I must go. I have promised to meet a man at the\\nOrleans. Good-bye, Mr. Gray. Come and see me some afternoon in Curzon\\nStreet. I am nearly always at home at five o’clock. Write to me when\\nyou are coming. I should be sorry to miss you.”\\n\\n“Basil,” cried Dorian Gray, “if Lord Henry Wotton goes, I shall go,\\ntoo. You never open your lips while you are painting, and it is\\nhorribly dull standing on a platform and trying to look pleasant. Ask\\nhim to stay. I insist upon it.”\\n\\n“Stay, Harry, to oblige Dorian, and to oblige me,” said Hallward,\\ngazing intently at his picture. “It is quite true, I never talk when I\\nam working, and never listen either, and it must be dreadfully tedious\\nfor my unfortunate sitters. I beg you to stay.”\\n\\n“But what about my man at the Orleans?”\\n\\nThe painter laughed. “I don’t think there will be any difficulty about\\nthat. Sit down again, Harry. And now, Dorian, get up on the platform,\\nand don’t move about too much, or pay any attention to what Lord Henry\\nsays. He has a very bad influence over all his friends, with the single\\nexception of myself.”\\n\\nDorian Gray stepped up on the dais with the air of a young Greek\\nmartyr, and made a little _moue_ of discontent to Lord Henry, to whom\\nhe had rather taken a fancy. He was so unlike Basil. They made a\\ndelightful contrast. And he had such a beautiful voice. After a few\\nmoments he said to him, “Have you really a very bad influence, Lord\\nHenry? As bad as Basil says?”\\n\\n“There is no such thing as a good influence, Mr. Gray. All influence is\\nimmoral—immoral from the scientific point of view.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“Because to influence a person is to give him one’s own soul. He does\\nnot think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. His\\nvirtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are such things as\\nsins, are borrowed. He becomes an echo of some one else’s music, an\\nactor of a part that has not been written for him. The aim of life is\\nself-development. To realize one’s nature perfectly—that is what each\\nof us is here for. People are afraid of themselves, nowadays. They have\\nforgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to one’s\\nself. Of course, they are charitable. They feed the hungry and clothe\\nthe beggar. But their own souls starve, and are naked. Courage has gone\\nout of our race. Perhaps we never really had it. The terror of society,\\nwhich is the basis of morals, the terror of God, which is the secret of\\nreligion—these are the two things that govern us. And yet—”\\n\\n“Just turn your head a little more to the right, Dorian, like a good\\nboy,” said the painter, deep in his work and conscious only that a look\\nhad come into the lad’s face that he had never seen there before.\\n\\n“And yet,” continued Lord Henry, in his low, musical voice, and with\\nthat graceful wave of the hand that was always so characteristic of\\nhim, and that he had even in his Eton days, “I believe that if one man\\nwere to live out his life fully and completely, were to give form to\\nevery feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream—I\\nbelieve that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we\\nwould forget all the maladies of mediævalism, and return to the\\nHellenic ideal—to something finer, richer than the Hellenic ideal, it\\nmay be. But the bravest man amongst us is afraid of himself. The\\nmutilation of the savage has its tragic survival in the self-denial\\nthat mars our lives. We are punished for our refusals. Every impulse\\nthat we strive to strangle broods in the mind and poisons us. The body\\nsins once, and has done with its sin, for action is a mode of\\npurification. Nothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure,\\nor the luxury of a regret. The only way to get rid of a temptation is\\nto yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for\\nthe things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its\\nmonstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful. It has been said that\\nthe great events of the world take place in the brain. It is in the\\nbrain, and the brain only, that the great sins of the world take place\\nalso. You, Mr. Gray, you yourself, with your rose-red youth and your\\nrose-white boyhood, you have had passions that have made you afraid,\\nthoughts that have filled you with terror, day-dreams and sleeping\\ndreams whose mere memory might stain your cheek with shame—”\\n\\n“Stop!” faltered Dorian Gray, “stop! you bewilder me. I don’t know what\\nto say. There is some answer to you, but I cannot find it. Don’t speak.\\nLet me think. Or, rather, let me try not to think.”\\n\\nFor nearly ten minutes he stood there, motionless, with parted lips and\\neyes strangely bright. He was dimly conscious that entirely fresh\\ninfluences were at work within him. Yet they seemed to him to have come\\nreally from himself. The few words that Basil’s friend had said to\\nhim—words spoken by chance, no doubt, and with wilful paradox in\\nthem—had touched some secret chord that had never been touched before,\\nbut that he felt was now vibrating and throbbing to curious pulses.\\n\\nMusic had stirred him like that. Music had troubled him many times. But\\nmusic was not articulate. It was not a new world, but rather another\\nchaos, that it created in us. Words! Mere words! How terrible they\\nwere! How clear, and vivid, and cruel! One could not escape from them.\\nAnd yet what a subtle magic there was in them! They seemed to be able\\nto give a plastic form to formless things, and to have a music of their\\nown as sweet as that of viol or of lute. Mere words! Was there anything\\nso real as words?\\n\\nYes; there had been things in his boyhood that he had not understood.\\nHe understood them now. Life suddenly became fiery-coloured to him. It\\nseemed to him that he had been walking in fire. Why had he not known\\nit?\\n\\nWith his subtle smile, Lord Henry watched him. He knew the precise\\npsychological moment when to say nothing. He felt intensely interested.\\nHe was amazed at the sudden impression that his words had produced,\\nand, remembering a book that he had read when he was sixteen, a book\\nwhich had revealed to him much that he had not known before, he\\nwondered whether Dorian Gray was passing through a similar experience.\\nHe had merely shot an arrow into the air. Had it hit the mark? How\\nfascinating the lad was!\\n\\nHallward painted away with that marvellous bold touch of his, that had\\nthe true refinement and perfect delicacy that in art, at any rate comes\\nonly from strength. He was unconscious of the silence.\\n\\n“Basil, I am tired of standing,” cried Dorian Gray suddenly. “I must go\\nout and sit in the garden. The air is stifling here.”\\n\\n“My dear fellow, I am so sorry. When I am painting, I can’t think of\\nanything else. But you never sat better. You were perfectly still. And\\nI have caught the effect I wanted—the half-parted lips and the bright\\nlook in the eyes. I don’t know what Harry has been saying to you, but\\nhe has certainly made you have the most wonderful expression. I suppose\\nhe has been paying you compliments. You mustn’t believe a word that he\\nsays.”\\n\\n“He has certainly not been paying me compliments. Perhaps that is the\\nreason that I don’t believe anything he has told me.”\\n\\n“You know you believe it all,” said Lord Henry, looking at him with his\\ndreamy languorous eyes. “I will go out to the garden with you. It is\\nhorribly hot in the studio. Basil, let us have something iced to drink,\\nsomething with strawberries in it.”\\n\\n“Certainly, Harry. Just touch the bell, and when Parker comes I will\\ntell him what you want. I have got to work up this background, so I\\nwill join you later on. Don’t keep Dorian too long. I have never been\\nin better form for painting than I am to-day. This is going to be my\\nmasterpiece. It is my masterpiece as it stands.”\\n\\nLord Henry went out to the garden and found Dorian Gray burying his\\nface in the great cool lilac-blossoms, feverishly drinking in their\\nperfume as if it had been wine. He came close to him and put his hand\\nupon his shoulder. “You are quite right to do that,” he murmured.\\n“Nothing can cure the soul but the senses, just as nothing can cure the\\nsenses but the soul.”\\n\\nThe lad started and drew back. He was bareheaded, and the leaves had\\ntossed his rebellious curls and tangled all their gilded threads. There\\nwas a look of fear in his eyes, such as people have when they are\\nsuddenly awakened. His finely chiselled nostrils quivered, and some\\nhidden nerve shook the scarlet of his lips and left them trembling.\\n\\n“Yes,” continued Lord Henry, “that is one of the great secrets of\\nlife—to cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means\\nof the soul. You are a wonderful creation. You know more than you think\\nyou know, just as you know less than you want to know.”\\n\\nDorian Gray frowned and turned his head away. He could not help liking\\nthe tall, graceful young man who was standing by him. His romantic,\\nolive-coloured face and worn expression interested him. There was\\nsomething in his low languid voice that was absolutely fascinating. His\\ncool, white, flowerlike hands, even, had a curious charm. They moved,\\nas he spoke, like music, and seemed to have a language of their own.\\nBut he felt afraid of him, and ashamed of being afraid. Why had it been\\nleft for a stranger to reveal him to himself? He had known Basil\\nHallward for months, but the friendship between them had never altered\\nhim. Suddenly there had come some one across his life who seemed to\\nhave disclosed to him life’s mystery. And, yet, what was there to be\\nafraid of? He was not a schoolboy or a girl. It was absurd to be\\nfrightened.\\n\\n“Let us go and sit in the shade,” said Lord Henry. “Parker has brought\\nout the drinks, and if you stay any longer in this glare, you will be\\nquite spoiled, and Basil will never paint you again. You really must\\nnot allow yourself to become sunburnt. It would be unbecoming.”\\n\\n“What can it matter?” cried Dorian Gray, laughing, as he sat down on\\nthe seat at the end of the garden.\\n\\n“It should matter everything to you, Mr. Gray.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“Because you have the most marvellous youth, and youth is the one thing\\nworth having.”\\n\\n“I don’t feel that, Lord Henry.”\\n\\n“No, you don’t feel it now. Some day, when you are old and wrinkled and\\nugly, when thought has seared your forehead with its lines, and passion\\nbranded your lips with its hideous fires, you will feel it, you will\\nfeel it terribly. Now, wherever you go, you charm the world. Will it\\nalways be so? ... You have a wonderfully beautiful face, Mr. Gray.\\nDon’t frown. You have. And beauty is a form of genius—is higher,\\nindeed, than genius, as it needs no explanation. It is of the great\\nfacts of the world, like sunlight, or spring-time, or the reflection in\\ndark waters of that silver shell we call the moon. It cannot be\\nquestioned. It has its divine right of sovereignty. It makes princes of\\nthose who have it. You smile? Ah! when you have lost it you won’t\\nsmile.... People say sometimes that beauty is only superficial. That\\nmay be so, but at least it is not so superficial as thought is. To me,\\nbeauty is the wonder of wonders. It is only shallow people who do not\\njudge by appearances. The true mystery of the world is the visible, not\\nthe invisible.... Yes, Mr. Gray, the gods have been good to you. But\\nwhat the gods give they quickly take away. You have only a few years in\\nwhich to live really, perfectly, and fully. When your youth goes, your\\nbeauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that there\\nare no triumphs left for you, or have to content yourself with those\\nmean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter than\\ndefeats. Every month as it wanes brings you nearer to something\\ndreadful. Time is jealous of you, and wars against your lilies and your\\nroses. You will become sallow, and hollow-cheeked, and dull-eyed. You\\nwill suffer horribly.... Ah! realize your youth while you have it.\\nDon’t squander the gold of your days, listening to the tedious, trying\\nto improve the hopeless failure, or giving away your life to the\\nignorant, the common, and the vulgar. These are the sickly aims, the\\nfalse ideals, of our age. Live! Live the wonderful life that is in you!\\nLet nothing be lost upon you. Be always searching for new sensations.\\nBe afraid of nothing.... A new Hedonism—that is what our century wants.\\nYou might be its visible symbol. With your personality there is nothing\\nyou could not do. The world belongs to you for a season.... The moment\\nI met you I saw that you were quite unconscious of what you really are,\\nof what you really might be. There was so much in you that charmed me\\nthat I felt I must tell you something about yourself. I thought how\\ntragic it would be if you were wasted. For there is such a little time\\nthat your youth will last—such a little time. The common hill-flowers\\nwither, but they blossom again. The laburnum will be as yellow next\\nJune as it is now. In a month there will be purple stars on the\\nclematis, and year after year the green night of its leaves will hold\\nits purple stars. But we never get back our youth. The pulse of joy\\nthat beats in us at twenty becomes sluggish. Our limbs fail, our senses\\nrot. We degenerate into hideous puppets, haunted by the memory of the\\npassions of which we were too much afraid, and the exquisite\\ntemptations that we had not the courage to yield to. Youth! Youth!\\nThere is absolutely nothing in the world but youth!”\\n\\nDorian Gray listened, open-eyed and wondering. The spray of lilac fell\\nfrom his hand upon the gravel. A furry bee came and buzzed round it for\\na moment. Then it began to scramble all over the oval stellated globe\\nof the tiny blossoms. He watched it with that strange interest in\\ntrivial things that we try to develop when things of high import make\\nus afraid, or when we are stirred by some new emotion for which we\\ncannot find expression, or when some thought that terrifies us lays\\nsudden siege to the brain and calls on us to yield. After a time the\\nbee flew away. He saw it creeping into the stained trumpet of a Tyrian\\nconvolvulus. The flower seemed to quiver, and then swayed gently to and\\nfro.\\n\\nSuddenly the painter appeared at the door of the studio and made\\nstaccato signs for them to come in. They turned to each other and\\nsmiled.\\n\\n“I am waiting,” he cried. “Do come in. The light is quite perfect, and\\nyou can bring your drinks.”\\n\\nThey rose up and sauntered down the walk together. Two green-and-white\\nbutterflies fluttered past them, and in the pear-tree at the corner of\\nthe garden a thrush began to sing.\\n\\n“You are glad you have met me, Mr. Gray,” said Lord Henry, looking at\\nhim.\\n\\n“Yes, I am glad now. I wonder shall I always be glad?”\\n\\n“Always! That is a dreadful word. It makes me shudder when I hear it.\\nWomen are so fond of using it. They spoil every romance by trying to\\nmake it last for ever. It is a meaningless word, too. The only\\ndifference between a caprice and a lifelong passion is that the caprice\\nlasts a little longer.”\\n\\nAs they entered the studio, Dorian Gray put his hand upon Lord Henry’s\\narm. “In that case, let our friendship be a caprice,” he murmured,\\nflushing at his own boldness, then stepped up on the platform and\\nresumed his pose.\\n\\nLord Henry flung himself into a large wicker arm-chair and watched him.\\nThe sweep and dash of the brush on the canvas made the only sound that\\nbroke the stillness, except when, now and then, Hallward stepped back\\nto look at his work from a distance. In the slanting beams that\\nstreamed through the open doorway the dust danced and was golden. The\\nheavy scent of the roses seemed to brood over everything.\\n\\nAfter about a quarter of an hour Hallward stopped painting, looked for\\na long time at Dorian Gray, and then for a long time at the picture,\\nbiting the end of one of his huge brushes and frowning. “It is quite\\nfinished,” he cried at last, and stooping down he wrote his name in\\nlong vermilion letters on the left-hand corner of the canvas.\\n\\nLord Henry came over and examined the picture. It was certainly a\\nwonderful work of art, and a wonderful likeness as well.\\n\\n“My dear fellow, I congratulate you most warmly,” he said. “It is the\\nfinest portrait of modern times. Mr. Gray, come over and look at\\nyourself.”\\n\\nThe lad started, as if awakened from some dream.\\n\\n“Is it really finished?” he murmured, stepping down from the platform.\\n\\n“Quite finished,” said the painter. “And you have sat splendidly\\nto-day. I am awfully obliged to you.”\\n\\n“That is entirely due to me,” broke in Lord Henry. “Isn’t it, Mr.\\nGray?”\\n\\nDorian made no answer, but passed listlessly in front of his picture\\nand turned towards it. When he saw it he drew back, and his cheeks\\nflushed for a moment with pleasure. A look of joy came into his eyes,\\nas if he had recognized himself for the first time. He stood there\\nmotionless and in wonder, dimly conscious that Hallward was speaking to\\nhim, but not catching the meaning of his words. The sense of his own\\nbeauty came on him like a revelation. He had never felt it before.\\nBasil Hallward’s compliments had seemed to him to be merely the\\ncharming exaggeration of friendship. He had listened to them, laughed\\nat them, forgotten them. They had not influenced his nature. Then had\\ncome Lord Henry Wotton with his strange panegyric on youth, his\\nterrible warning of its brevity. That had stirred him at the time, and\\nnow, as he stood gazing at the shadow of his own loveliness, the full\\nreality of the description flashed across him. Yes, there would be a\\nday when his face would be wrinkled and wizen, his eyes dim and\\ncolourless, the grace of his figure broken and deformed. The scarlet\\nwould pass away from his lips and the gold steal from his hair. The\\nlife that was to make his soul would mar his body. He would become\\ndreadful, hideous, and uncouth.\\n\\nAs he thought of it, a sharp pang of pain struck through him like a\\nknife and made each delicate fibre of his nature quiver. His eyes\\ndeepened into amethyst, and across them came a mist of tears. He felt\\nas if a hand of ice had been laid upon his heart.\\n\\n“Don’t you like it?” cried Hallward at last, stung a little by the\\nlad’s silence, not understanding what it meant.\\n\\n“Of course he likes it,” said Lord Henry. “Who wouldn’t like it? It is\\none of the greatest things in modern art. I will give you anything you\\nlike to ask for it. I must have it.”\\n\\n“It is not my property, Harry.”\\n\\n“Whose property is it?”\\n\\n“Dorian’s, of course,” answered the painter.\\n\\n“He is a very lucky fellow.”\\n\\n“How sad it is!” murmured Dorian Gray with his eyes still fixed upon\\nhis own portrait. “How sad it is! I shall grow old, and horrible, and\\ndreadful. But this picture will remain always young. It will never be\\nolder than this particular day of June.... If it were only the other\\nway! If it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that was\\nto grow old! For that—for that—I would give everything! Yes, there is\\nnothing in the whole world I would not give! I would give my soul for\\nthat!”\\n\\n“You would hardly care for such an arrangement, Basil,” cried Lord\\nHenry, laughing. “It would be rather hard lines on your work.”\\n\\n“I should object very strongly, Harry,” said Hallward.\\n\\nDorian Gray turned and looked at him. “I believe you would, Basil. You\\nlike your art better than your friends. I am no more to you than a\\ngreen bronze figure. Hardly as much, I dare say.”\\n\\nThe painter stared in amazement. It was so unlike Dorian to speak like\\nthat. What had happened? He seemed quite angry. His face was flushed\\nand his cheeks burning.\\n\\n“Yes,” he continued, “I am less to you than your ivory Hermes or your\\nsilver Faun. You will like them always. How long will you like me? Till\\nI have my first wrinkle, I suppose. I know, now, that when one loses\\none’s good looks, whatever they may be, one loses everything. Your\\npicture has taught me that. Lord Henry Wotton is perfectly right. Youth\\nis the only thing worth having. When I find that I am growing old, I\\nshall kill myself.”\\n\\nHallward turned pale and caught his hand. “Dorian! Dorian!” he cried,\\n“don’t talk like that. I have never had such a friend as you, and I\\nshall never have such another. You are not jealous of material things,\\nare you?—you who are finer than any of them!”\\n\\n“I am jealous of everything whose beauty does not die. I am jealous of\\nthe portrait you have painted of me. Why should it keep what I must\\nlose? Every moment that passes takes something from me and gives\\nsomething to it. Oh, if it were only the other way! If the picture\\ncould change, and I could be always what I am now! Why did you paint\\nit? It will mock me some day—mock me horribly!” The hot tears welled\\ninto his eyes; he tore his hand away and, flinging himself on the\\ndivan, he buried his face in the cushions, as though he was praying.\\n\\n“This is your doing, Harry,” said the painter bitterly.\\n\\nLord Henry shrugged his shoulders. “It is the real Dorian Gray—that is\\nall.”\\n\\n“It is not.”\\n\\n“If it is not, what have I to do with it?”\\n\\n“You should have gone away when I asked you,” he muttered.\\n\\n“I stayed when you asked me,” was Lord Henry’s answer.\\n\\n“Harry, I can’t quarrel with my two best friends at once, but between\\nyou both you have made me hate the finest piece of work I have ever\\ndone, and I will destroy it. What is it but canvas and colour? I will\\nnot let it come across our three lives and mar them.”\\n\\nDorian Gray lifted his golden head from the pillow, and with pallid\\nface and tear-stained eyes, looked at him as he walked over to the deal\\npainting-table that was set beneath the high curtained window. What was\\nhe doing there? His fingers were straying about among the litter of tin\\ntubes and dry brushes, seeking for something. Yes, it was for the long\\npalette-knife, with its thin blade of lithe steel. He had found it at\\nlast. He was going to rip up the canvas.\\n\\nWith a stifled sob the lad leaped from the couch, and, rushing over to\\nHallward, tore the knife out of his hand, and flung it to the end of\\nthe studio. “Don’t, Basil, don’t!” he cried. “It would be murder!”\\n\\n“I am glad you appreciate my work at last, Dorian,” said the painter\\ncoldly when he had recovered from his surprise. “I never thought you\\nwould.”\\n\\n“Appreciate it? I am in love with it, Basil. It is part of myself. I\\nfeel that.”\\n\\n“Well, as soon as you are dry, you shall be varnished, and framed, and\\nsent home. Then you can do what you like with yourself.” And he walked\\nacross the room and rang the bell for tea. “You will have tea, of\\ncourse, Dorian? And so will you, Harry? Or do you object to such simple\\npleasures?”\\n\\n“I adore simple pleasures,” said Lord Henry. “They are the last refuge\\nof the complex. But I don’t like scenes, except on the stage. What\\nabsurd fellows you are, both of you! I wonder who it was defined man as\\na rational animal. It was the most premature definition ever given. Man\\nis many things, but he is not rational. I am glad he is not, after\\nall—though I wish you chaps would not squabble over the picture. You\\nhad much better let me have it, Basil. This silly boy doesn’t really\\nwant it, and I really do.”\\n\\n“If you let any one have it but me, Basil, I shall never forgive you!”\\ncried Dorian Gray; “and I don’t allow people to call me a silly boy.”\\n\\n“You know the picture is yours, Dorian. I gave it to you before it\\nexisted.”\\n\\n“And you know you have been a little silly, Mr. Gray, and that you\\ndon’t really object to being reminded that you are extremely young.”\\n\\n“I should have objected very strongly this morning, Lord Henry.”\\n\\n“Ah! this morning! You have lived since then.”\\n\\nThere came a knock at the door, and the butler entered with a laden\\ntea-tray and set it down upon a small Japanese table. There was a\\nrattle of cups and saucers and the hissing of a fluted Georgian urn.\\nTwo globe-shaped china dishes were brought in by a page. Dorian Gray\\nwent over and poured out the tea. The two men sauntered languidly to\\nthe table and examined what was under the covers.\\n\\n“Let us go to the theatre to-night,” said Lord Henry. “There is sure to\\nbe something on, somewhere. I have promised to dine at White’s, but it\\nis only with an old friend, so I can send him a wire to say that I am\\nill, or that I am prevented from coming in consequence of a subsequent\\nengagement. I think that would be a rather nice excuse: it would have\\nall the surprise of candour.”\\n\\n“It is such a bore putting on one’s dress-clothes,” muttered Hallward.\\n“And, when one has them on, they are so horrid.”\\n\\n“Yes,” answered Lord Henry dreamily, “the costume of the nineteenth\\ncentury is detestable. It is so sombre, so depressing. Sin is the only\\nreal colour-element left in modern life.”\\n\\n“You really must not say things like that before Dorian, Harry.”\\n\\n“Before which Dorian? The one who is pouring out tea for us, or the one\\nin the picture?”\\n\\n“Before either.”\\n\\n“I should like to come to the theatre with you, Lord Henry,” said the\\nlad.\\n\\n“Then you shall come; and you will come, too, Basil, won’t you?”\\n\\n“I can’t, really. I would sooner not. I have a lot of work to do.”\\n\\n“Well, then, you and I will go alone, Mr. Gray.”\\n\\n“I should like that awfully.”\\n\\nThe painter bit his lip and walked over, cup in hand, to the picture.\\n“I shall stay with the real Dorian,” he said, sadly.\\n\\n“Is it the real Dorian?” cried the original of the portrait, strolling\\nacross to him. “Am I really like that?”\\n\\n“Yes; you are just like that.”\\n\\n“How wonderful, Basil!”\\n\\n“At least you are like it in appearance. But it will never alter,”\\nsighed Hallward. “That is something.”\\n\\n“What a fuss people make about fidelity!” exclaimed Lord Henry. “Why,\\neven in love it is purely a question for physiology. It has nothing to\\ndo with our own will. Young men want to be faithful, and are not; old\\nmen want to be faithless, and cannot: that is all one can say.”\\n\\n“Don’t go to the theatre to-night, Dorian,” said Hallward. “Stop and\\ndine with me.”\\n\\n“I can’t, Basil.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“Because I have promised Lord Henry Wotton to go with him.”\\n\\n“He won’t like you the better for keeping your promises. He always\\nbreaks his own. I beg you not to go.”\\n\\nDorian Gray laughed and shook his head.\\n\\n“I entreat you.”\\n\\nThe lad hesitated, and looked over at Lord Henry, who was watching them\\nfrom the tea-table with an amused smile.\\n\\n“I must go, Basil,” he answered.\\n\\n“Very well,” said Hallward, and he went over and laid down his cup on\\nthe tray. “It is rather late, and, as you have to dress, you had better\\nlose no time. Good-bye, Harry. Good-bye, Dorian. Come and see me soon.\\nCome to-morrow.”\\n\\n“Certainly.”\\n\\n“You won’t forget?”\\n\\n“No, of course not,” cried Dorian.\\n\\n“And ... Harry!”\\n\\n“Yes, Basil?”\\n\\n“Remember what I asked you, when we were in the garden this morning.”\\n\\n“I have forgotten it.”\\n\\n“I trust you.”\\n\\n“I wish I could trust myself,” said Lord Henry, laughing. “Come, Mr.\\nGray, my hansom is outside, and I can drop you at your own place.\\nGood-bye, Basil. It has been a most interesting afternoon.”\\n\\nAs the door closed behind them, the painter flung himself down on a\\nsofa, and a look of pain came into his face.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III.\\n\\n\\nAt half-past twelve next day Lord Henry Wotton strolled from Curzon\\nStreet over to the Albany to call on his uncle, Lord Fermor, a genial\\nif somewhat rough-mannered old bachelor, whom the outside world called\\nselfish because it derived no particular benefit from him, but who was\\nconsidered generous by Society as he fed the people who amused him. His\\nfather had been our ambassador at Madrid when Isabella was young and\\nPrim unthought of, but had retired from the diplomatic service in a\\ncapricious moment of annoyance on not being offered the Embassy at\\nParis, a post to which he considered that he was fully entitled by\\nreason of his birth, his indolence, the good English of his dispatches,\\nand his inordinate passion for pleasure. The son, who had been his\\nfather’s secretary, had resigned along with his chief, somewhat\\nfoolishly as was thought at the time, and on succeeding some months\\nlater to the title, had set himself to the serious study of the great\\naristocratic art of doing absolutely nothing. He had two large town\\nhouses, but preferred to live in chambers as it was less trouble, and\\ntook most of his meals at his club. He paid some attention to the\\nmanagement of his collieries in the Midland counties, excusing himself\\nfor this taint of industry on the ground that the one advantage of\\nhaving coal was that it enabled a gentleman to afford the decency of\\nburning wood on his own hearth. In politics he was a Tory, except when\\nthe Tories were in office, during which period he roundly abused them\\nfor being a pack of Radicals. He was a hero to his valet, who bullied\\nhim, and a terror to most of his relations, whom he bullied in turn.\\nOnly England could have produced him, and he always said that the\\ncountry was going to the dogs. His principles were out of date, but\\nthere was a good deal to be said for his prejudices.\\n\\nWhen Lord Henry entered the room, he found his uncle sitting in a rough\\nshooting-coat, smoking a cheroot and grumbling over _The Times_. “Well,\\nHarry,” said the old gentleman, “what brings you out so early? I\\nthought you dandies never got up till two, and were not visible till\\nfive.”\\n\\n“Pure family affection, I assure you, Uncle George. I want to get\\nsomething out of you.”\\n\\n“Money, I suppose,” said Lord Fermor, making a wry face. “Well, sit\\ndown and tell me all about it. Young people, nowadays, imagine that\\nmoney is everything.”\\n\\n“Yes,” murmured Lord Henry, settling his button-hole in his coat; “and\\nwhen they grow older they know it. But I don’t want money. It is only\\npeople who pay their bills who want that, Uncle George, and I never pay\\nmine. Credit is the capital of a younger son, and one lives charmingly\\nupon it. Besides, I always deal with Dartmoor’s tradesmen, and\\nconsequently they never bother me. What I want is information: not\\nuseful information, of course; useless information.”\\n\\n“Well, I can tell you anything that is in an English Blue Book, Harry,\\nalthough those fellows nowadays write a lot of nonsense. When I was in\\nthe Diplomatic, things were much better. But I hear they let them in\\nnow by examination. What can you expect? Examinations, sir, are pure\\nhumbug from beginning to end. If a man is a gentleman, he knows quite\\nenough, and if he is not a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for\\nhim.”\\n\\n“Mr. Dorian Gray does not belong to Blue Books, Uncle George,” said\\nLord Henry languidly.\\n\\n“Mr. Dorian Gray? Who is he?” asked Lord Fermor, knitting his bushy\\nwhite eyebrows.\\n\\n“That is what I have come to learn, Uncle George. Or rather, I know who\\nhe is. He is the last Lord Kelso’s grandson. His mother was a Devereux,\\nLady Margaret Devereux. I want you to tell me about his mother. What\\nwas she like? Whom did she marry? You have known nearly everybody in\\nyour time, so you might have known her. I am very much interested in\\nMr. Gray at present. I have only just met him.”\\n\\n“Kelso’s grandson!” echoed the old gentleman. “Kelso’s grandson! ... Of\\ncourse.... I knew his mother intimately. I believe I was at her\\nchristening. She was an extraordinarily beautiful girl, Margaret\\nDevereux, and made all the men frantic by running away with a penniless\\nyoung fellow—a mere nobody, sir, a subaltern in a foot regiment, or\\nsomething of that kind. Certainly. I remember the whole thing as if it\\nhappened yesterday. The poor chap was killed in a duel at Spa a few\\nmonths after the marriage. There was an ugly story about it. They said\\nKelso got some rascally adventurer, some Belgian brute, to insult his\\nson-in-law in public—paid him, sir, to do it, paid him—and that the\\nfellow spitted his man as if he had been a pigeon. The thing was hushed\\nup, but, egad, Kelso ate his chop alone at the club for some time\\nafterwards. He brought his daughter back with him, I was told, and she\\nnever spoke to him again. Oh, yes; it was a bad business. The girl\\ndied, too, died within a year. So she left a son, did she? I had\\nforgotten that. What sort of boy is he? If he is like his mother, he\\nmust be a good-looking chap.”\\n\\n“He is very good-looking,” assented Lord Henry.\\n\\n“I hope he will fall into proper hands,” continued the old man. “He\\nshould have a pot of money waiting for him if Kelso did the right thing\\nby him. His mother had money, too. All the Selby property came to her,\\nthrough her grandfather. Her grandfather hated Kelso, thought him a\\nmean dog. He was, too. Came to Madrid once when I was there. Egad, I\\nwas ashamed of him. The Queen used to ask me about the English noble\\nwho was always quarrelling with the cabmen about their fares. They made\\nquite a story of it. I didn’t dare show my face at Court for a month. I\\nhope he treated his grandson better than he did the jarvies.”\\n\\n“I don’t know,” answered Lord Henry. “I fancy that the boy will be well\\noff. He is not of age yet. He has Selby, I know. He told me so. And ...\\nhis mother was very beautiful?”\\n\\n“Margaret Devereux was one of the loveliest creatures I ever saw,\\nHarry. What on earth induced her to behave as she did, I never could\\nunderstand. She could have married anybody she chose. Carlington was\\nmad after her. She was romantic, though. All the women of that family\\nwere. The men were a poor lot, but, egad! the women were wonderful.\\nCarlington went on his knees to her. Told me so himself. She laughed at\\nhim, and there wasn’t a girl in London at the time who wasn’t after\\nhim. And by the way, Harry, talking about silly marriages, what is this\\nhumbug your father tells me about Dartmoor wanting to marry an\\nAmerican? Ain’t English girls good enough for him?”\\n\\n“It is rather fashionable to marry Americans just now, Uncle George.”\\n\\n“I’ll back English women against the world, Harry,” said Lord Fermor,\\nstriking the table with his fist.\\n\\n“The betting is on the Americans.”\\n\\n“They don’t last, I am told,” muttered his uncle.\\n\\n“A long engagement exhausts them, but they are capital at a\\nsteeplechase. They take things flying. I don’t think Dartmoor has a\\nchance.”\\n\\n“Who are her people?” grumbled the old gentleman. “Has she got any?”\\n\\nLord Henry shook his head. “American girls are as clever at concealing\\ntheir parents, as English women are at concealing their past,” he said,\\nrising to go.\\n\\n“They are pork-packers, I suppose?”\\n\\n“I hope so, Uncle George, for Dartmoor’s sake. I am told that\\npork-packing is the most lucrative profession in America, after\\npolitics.”\\n\\n“Is she pretty?”\\n\\n“She behaves as if she was beautiful. Most American women do. It is the\\nsecret of their charm.”\\n\\n“Why can’t these American women stay in their own country? They are\\nalways telling us that it is the paradise for women.”\\n\\n“It is. That is the reason why, like Eve, they are so excessively\\nanxious to get out of it,” said Lord Henry. “Good-bye, Uncle George. I\\nshall be late for lunch, if I stop any longer. Thanks for giving me the\\ninformation I wanted. I always like to know everything about my new\\nfriends, and nothing about my old ones.”\\n\\n“Where are you lunching, Harry?”\\n\\n“At Aunt Agatha’s. I have asked myself and Mr. Gray. He is her latest\\n_protégé_.”\\n\\n“Humph! tell your Aunt Agatha, Harry, not to bother me any more with\\nher charity appeals. I am sick of them. Why, the good woman thinks that\\nI have nothing to do but to write cheques for her silly fads.”\\n\\n“All right, Uncle George, I’ll tell her, but it won’t have any effect.\\nPhilanthropic people lose all sense of humanity. It is their\\ndistinguishing characteristic.”\\n\\nThe old gentleman growled approvingly and rang the bell for his\\nservant. Lord Henry passed up the low arcade into Burlington Street and\\nturned his steps in the direction of Berkeley Square.\\n\\nSo that was the story of Dorian Gray’s parentage. Crudely as it had\\nbeen told to him, it had yet stirred him by its suggestion of a\\nstrange, almost modern romance. A beautiful woman risking everything\\nfor a mad passion. A few wild weeks of happiness cut short by a\\nhideous, treacherous crime. Months of voiceless agony, and then a child\\nborn in pain. The mother snatched away by death, the boy left to\\nsolitude and the tyranny of an old and loveless man. Yes; it was an\\ninteresting background. It posed the lad, made him more perfect, as it\\nwere. Behind every exquisite thing that existed, there was something\\ntragic. Worlds had to be in travail, that the meanest flower might\\nblow.... And how charming he had been at dinner the night before, as\\nwith startled eyes and lips parted in frightened pleasure he had sat\\nopposite to him at the club, the red candleshades staining to a richer\\nrose the wakening wonder of his face. Talking to him was like playing\\nupon an exquisite violin. He answered to every touch and thrill of the\\nbow.... There was something terribly enthralling in the exercise of\\ninfluence. No other activity was like it. To project one’s soul into\\nsome gracious form, and let it tarry there for a moment; to hear one’s\\nown intellectual views echoed back to one with all the added music of\\npassion and youth; to convey one’s temperament into another as though\\nit were a subtle fluid or a strange perfume: there was a real joy in\\nthat—perhaps the most satisfying joy left to us in an age so limited\\nand vulgar as our own, an age grossly carnal in its pleasures, and\\ngrossly common in its aims.... He was a marvellous type, too, this lad,\\nwhom by so curious a chance he had met in Basil’s studio, or could be\\nfashioned into a marvellous type, at any rate. Grace was his, and the\\nwhite purity of boyhood, and beauty such as old Greek marbles kept for\\nus. There was nothing that one could not do with him. He could be made\\na Titan or a toy. What a pity it was that such beauty was destined to\\nfade! ... And Basil? From a psychological point of view, how\\ninteresting he was! The new manner in art, the fresh mode of looking at\\nlife, suggested so strangely by the merely visible presence of one who\\nwas unconscious of it all; the silent spirit that dwelt in dim\\nwoodland, and walked unseen in open field, suddenly showing herself,\\nDryadlike and not afraid, because in his soul who sought for her there\\nhad been wakened that wonderful vision to which alone are wonderful\\nthings revealed; the mere shapes and patterns of things becoming, as it\\nwere, refined, and gaining a kind of symbolical value, as though they\\nwere themselves patterns of some other and more perfect form whose\\nshadow they made real: how strange it all was! He remembered something\\nlike it in history. Was it not Plato, that artist in thought, who had\\nfirst analyzed it? Was it not Buonarotti who had carved it in the\\ncoloured marbles of a sonnet-sequence? But in our own century it was\\nstrange.... Yes; he would try to be to Dorian Gray what, without\\nknowing it, the lad was to the painter who had fashioned the wonderful\\nportrait. He would seek to dominate him—had already, indeed, half done\\nso. He would make that wonderful spirit his own. There was something\\nfascinating in this son of love and death.\\n\\nSuddenly he stopped and glanced up at the houses. He found that he had\\npassed his aunt’s some distance, and, smiling to himself, turned back.\\nWhen he entered the somewhat sombre hall, the butler told him that they\\nhad gone in to lunch. He gave one of the footmen his hat and stick and\\npassed into the dining-room.\\n\\n“Late as usual, Harry,” cried his aunt, shaking her head at him.\\n\\nHe invented a facile excuse, and having taken the vacant seat next to\\nher, looked round to see who was there. Dorian bowed to him shyly from\\nthe end of the table, a flush of pleasure stealing into his cheek.\\nOpposite was the Duchess of Harley, a lady of admirable good-nature and\\ngood temper, much liked by every one who knew her, and of those ample\\narchitectural proportions that in women who are not duchesses are\\ndescribed by contemporary historians as stoutness. Next to her sat, on\\nher right, Sir Thomas Burdon, a Radical member of Parliament, who\\nfollowed his leader in public life and in private life followed the\\nbest cooks, dining with the Tories and thinking with the Liberals, in\\naccordance with a wise and well-known rule. The post on her left was\\noccupied by Mr. Erskine of Treadley, an old gentleman of considerable\\ncharm and culture, who had fallen, however, into bad habits of silence,\\nhaving, as he explained once to Lady Agatha, said everything that he\\nhad to say before he was thirty. His own neighbour was Mrs. Vandeleur,\\none of his aunt’s oldest friends, a perfect saint amongst women, but so\\ndreadfully dowdy that she reminded one of a badly bound hymn-book.\\nFortunately for him she had on the other side Lord Faudel, a most\\nintelligent middle-aged mediocrity, as bald as a ministerial statement\\nin the House of Commons, with whom she was conversing in that intensely\\nearnest manner which is the one unpardonable error, as he remarked once\\nhimself, that all really good people fall into, and from which none of\\nthem ever quite escape.\\n\\n“We are talking about poor Dartmoor, Lord Henry,” cried the duchess,\\nnodding pleasantly to him across the table. “Do you think he will\\nreally marry this fascinating young person?”\\n\\n“I believe she has made up her mind to propose to him, Duchess.”\\n\\n“How dreadful!” exclaimed Lady Agatha. “Really, some one should\\ninterfere.”\\n\\n“I am told, on excellent authority, that her father keeps an American\\ndry-goods store,” said Sir Thomas Burdon, looking supercilious.\\n\\n“My uncle has already suggested pork-packing, Sir Thomas.”\\n\\n“Dry-goods! What are American dry-goods?” asked the duchess, raising\\nher large hands in wonder and accentuating the verb.\\n\\n“American novels,” answered Lord Henry, helping himself to some quail.\\n\\nThe duchess looked puzzled.\\n\\n“Don’t mind him, my dear,” whispered Lady Agatha. “He never means\\nanything that he says.”\\n\\n“When America was discovered,” said the Radical member—and he began to\\ngive some wearisome facts. Like all people who try to exhaust a\\nsubject, he exhausted his listeners. The duchess sighed and exercised\\nher privilege of interruption. “I wish to goodness it never had been\\ndiscovered at all!” she exclaimed. “Really, our girls have no chance\\nnowadays. It is most unfair.”\\n\\n“Perhaps, after all, America never has been discovered,” said Mr.\\nErskine; “I myself would say that it had merely been detected.”\\n\\n“Oh! but I have seen specimens of the inhabitants,” answered the\\nduchess vaguely. “I must confess that most of them are extremely\\npretty. And they dress well, too. They get all their dresses in Paris.\\nI wish I could afford to do the same.”\\n\\n“They say that when good Americans die they go to Paris,” chuckled Sir\\nThomas, who had a large wardrobe of Humour’s cast-off clothes.\\n\\n“Really! And where do bad Americans go to when they die?” inquired the\\nduchess.\\n\\n“They go to America,” murmured Lord Henry.\\n\\nSir Thomas frowned. “I am afraid that your nephew is prejudiced against\\nthat great country,” he said to Lady Agatha. “I have travelled all over\\nit in cars provided by the directors, who, in such matters, are\\nextremely civil. I assure you that it is an education to visit it.”\\n\\n“But must we really see Chicago in order to be educated?” asked Mr.\\nErskine plaintively. “I don’t feel up to the journey.”\\n\\nSir Thomas waved his hand. “Mr. Erskine of Treadley has the world on\\nhis shelves. We practical men like to see things, not to read about\\nthem. The Americans are an extremely interesting people. They are\\nabsolutely reasonable. I think that is their distinguishing\\ncharacteristic. Yes, Mr. Erskine, an absolutely reasonable people. I\\nassure you there is no nonsense about the Americans.”\\n\\n“How dreadful!” cried Lord Henry. “I can stand brute force, but brute\\nreason is quite unbearable. There is something unfair about its use. It\\nis hitting below the intellect.”\\n\\n“I do not understand you,” said Sir Thomas, growing rather red.\\n\\n“I do, Lord Henry,” murmured Mr. Erskine, with a smile.\\n\\n“Paradoxes are all very well in their way....” rejoined the baronet.\\n\\n“Was that a paradox?” asked Mr. Erskine. “I did not think so. Perhaps\\nit was. Well, the way of paradoxes is the way of truth. To test reality\\nwe must see it on the tight rope. When the verities become acrobats, we\\ncan judge them.”\\n\\n“Dear me!” said Lady Agatha, “how you men argue! I am sure I never can\\nmake out what you are talking about. Oh! Harry, I am quite vexed with\\nyou. Why do you try to persuade our nice Mr. Dorian Gray to give up the\\nEast End? I assure you he would be quite invaluable. They would love\\nhis playing.”\\n\\n“I want him to play to me,” cried Lord Henry, smiling, and he looked\\ndown the table and caught a bright answering glance.\\n\\n“But they are so unhappy in Whitechapel,” continued Lady Agatha.\\n\\n“I can sympathize with everything except suffering,” said Lord Henry,\\nshrugging his shoulders. “I cannot sympathize with that. It is too\\nugly, too horrible, too distressing. There is something terribly morbid\\nin the modern sympathy with pain. One should sympathize with the\\ncolour, the beauty, the joy of life. The less said about life’s sores,\\nthe better.”\\n\\n“Still, the East End is a very important problem,” remarked Sir Thomas\\nwith a grave shake of the head.\\n\\n“Quite so,” answered the young lord. “It is the problem of slavery, and\\nwe try to solve it by amusing the slaves.”\\n\\nThe politician looked at him keenly. “What change do you propose,\\nthen?” he asked.\\n\\nLord Henry laughed. “I don’t desire to change anything in England\\nexcept the weather,” he answered. “I am quite content with philosophic\\ncontemplation. But, as the nineteenth century has gone bankrupt through\\nan over-expenditure of sympathy, I would suggest that we should appeal\\nto science to put us straight. The advantage of the emotions is that\\nthey lead us astray, and the advantage of science is that it is not\\nemotional.”\\n\\n“But we have such grave responsibilities,” ventured Mrs. Vandeleur\\ntimidly.\\n\\n“Terribly grave,” echoed Lady Agatha.\\n\\nLord Henry looked over at Mr. Erskine. “Humanity takes itself too\\nseriously. It is the world’s original sin. If the caveman had known how\\nto laugh, history would have been different.”\\n\\n“You are really very comforting,” warbled the duchess. “I have always\\nfelt rather guilty when I came to see your dear aunt, for I take no\\ninterest at all in the East End. For the future I shall be able to look\\nher in the face without a blush.”\\n\\n“A blush is very becoming, Duchess,” remarked Lord Henry.\\n\\n“Only when one is young,” she answered. “When an old woman like myself\\nblushes, it is a very bad sign. Ah! Lord Henry, I wish you would tell\\nme how to become young again.”\\n\\nHe thought for a moment. “Can you remember any great error that you\\ncommitted in your early days, Duchess?” he asked, looking at her across\\nthe table.\\n\\n“A great many, I fear,” she cried.\\n\\n“Then commit them over again,” he said gravely. “To get back one’s\\nyouth, one has merely to repeat one’s follies.”\\n\\n“A delightful theory!” she exclaimed. “I must put it into practice.”\\n\\n“A dangerous theory!” came from Sir Thomas’s tight lips. Lady Agatha\\nshook her head, but could not help being amused. Mr. Erskine listened.\\n\\n“Yes,” he continued, “that is one of the great secrets of life.\\nNowadays most people die of a sort of creeping common sense, and\\ndiscover when it is too late that the only things one never regrets are\\none’s mistakes.”\\n\\nA laugh ran round the table.\\n\\nHe played with the idea and grew wilful; tossed it into the air and\\ntransformed it; let it escape and recaptured it; made it iridescent\\nwith fancy and winged it with paradox. The praise of folly, as he went\\non, soared into a philosophy, and philosophy herself became young, and\\ncatching the mad music of pleasure, wearing, one might fancy, her\\nwine-stained robe and wreath of ivy, danced like a Bacchante over the\\nhills of life, and mocked the slow Silenus for being sober. Facts fled\\nbefore her like frightened forest things. Her white feet trod the huge\\npress at which wise Omar sits, till the seething grape-juice rose round\\nher bare limbs in waves of purple bubbles, or crawled in red foam over\\nthe vat’s black, dripping, sloping sides. It was an extraordinary\\nimprovisation. He felt that the eyes of Dorian Gray were fixed on him,\\nand the consciousness that amongst his audience there was one whose\\ntemperament he wished to fascinate seemed to give his wit keenness and\\nto lend colour to his imagination. He was brilliant, fantastic,\\nirresponsible. He charmed his listeners out of themselves, and they\\nfollowed his pipe, laughing. Dorian Gray never took his gaze off him,\\nbut sat like one under a spell, smiles chasing each other over his lips\\nand wonder growing grave in his darkening eyes.\\n\\nAt last, liveried in the costume of the age, reality entered the room\\nin the shape of a servant to tell the duchess that her carriage was\\nwaiting. She wrung her hands in mock despair. “How annoying!” she\\ncried. “I must go. I have to call for my husband at the club, to take\\nhim to some absurd meeting at Willis’s Rooms, where he is going to be\\nin the chair. If I am late he is sure to be furious, and I couldn’t\\nhave a scene in this bonnet. It is far too fragile. A harsh word would\\nruin it. No, I must go, dear Agatha. Good-bye, Lord Henry, you are\\nquite delightful and dreadfully demoralizing. I am sure I don’t know\\nwhat to say about your views. You must come and dine with us some\\nnight. Tuesday? Are you disengaged Tuesday?”\\n\\n“For you I would throw over anybody, Duchess,” said Lord Henry with a\\nbow.\\n\\n“Ah! that is very nice, and very wrong of you,” she cried; “so mind you\\ncome”; and she swept out of the room, followed by Lady Agatha and the\\nother ladies.\\n\\nWhen Lord Henry had sat down again, Mr. Erskine moved round, and taking\\na chair close to him, placed his hand upon his arm.\\n\\n“You talk books away,” he said; “why don’t you write one?”\\n\\n“I am too fond of reading books to care to write them, Mr. Erskine. I\\nshould like to write a novel certainly, a novel that would be as lovely\\nas a Persian carpet and as unreal. But there is no literary public in\\nEngland for anything except newspapers, primers, and encyclopaedias. Of\\nall people in the world the English have the least sense of the beauty\\nof literature.”\\n\\n“I fear you are right,” answered Mr. Erskine. “I myself used to have\\nliterary ambitions, but I gave them up long ago. And now, my dear young\\nfriend, if you will allow me to call you so, may I ask if you really\\nmeant all that you said to us at lunch?”\\n\\n“I quite forget what I said,” smiled Lord Henry. “Was it all very bad?”\\n\\n“Very bad indeed. In fact I consider you extremely dangerous, and if\\nanything happens to our good duchess, we shall all look on you as being\\nprimarily responsible. But I should like to talk to you about life. The\\ngeneration into which I was born was tedious. Some day, when you are\\ntired of London, come down to Treadley and expound to me your\\nphilosophy of pleasure over some admirable Burgundy I am fortunate\\nenough to possess.”\\n\\n“I shall be charmed. A visit to Treadley would be a great privilege. It\\nhas a perfect host, and a perfect library.”\\n\\n“You will complete it,” answered the old gentleman with a courteous\\nbow. “And now I must bid good-bye to your excellent aunt. I am due at\\nthe Athenaeum. It is the hour when we sleep there.”\\n\\n“All of you, Mr. Erskine?”\\n\\n“Forty of us, in forty arm-chairs. We are practising for an English\\nAcademy of Letters.”\\n\\nLord Henry laughed and rose. “I am going to the park,” he cried.\\n\\nAs he was passing out of the door, Dorian Gray touched him on the arm.\\n“Let me come with you,” he murmured.\\n\\n“But I thought you had promised Basil Hallward to go and see him,”\\nanswered Lord Henry.\\n\\n“I would sooner come with you; yes, I feel I must come with you. Do let\\nme. And you will promise to talk to me all the time? No one talks so\\nwonderfully as you do.”\\n\\n“Ah! I have talked quite enough for to-day,” said Lord Henry, smiling.\\n“All I want now is to look at life. You may come and look at it with\\nme, if you care to.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV.\\n\\n\\nOne afternoon, a month later, Dorian Gray was reclining in a luxurious\\narm-chair, in the little library of Lord Henry’s house in Mayfair. It\\nwas, in its way, a very charming room, with its high panelled\\nwainscoting of olive-stained oak, its cream-coloured frieze and ceiling\\nof raised plasterwork, and its brickdust felt carpet strewn with silk,\\nlong-fringed Persian rugs. On a tiny satinwood table stood a statuette\\nby Clodion, and beside it lay a copy of Les Cent Nouvelles, bound for\\nMargaret of Valois by Clovis Eve and powdered with the gilt daisies\\nthat Queen had selected for her device. Some large blue china jars and\\nparrot-tulips were ranged on the mantelshelf, and through the small\\nleaded panes of the window streamed the apricot-coloured light of a\\nsummer day in London.\\n\\nLord Henry had not yet come in. He was always late on principle, his\\nprinciple being that punctuality is the thief of time. So the lad was\\nlooking rather sulky, as with listless fingers he turned over the pages\\nof an elaborately illustrated edition of Manon Lescaut that he had\\nfound in one of the book-cases. The formal monotonous ticking of the\\nLouis Quatorze clock annoyed him. Once or twice he thought of going\\naway.\\n\\nAt last he heard a step outside, and the door opened. “How late you\\nare, Harry!” he murmured.\\n\\n“I am afraid it is not Harry, Mr. Gray,” answered a shrill voice.\\n\\nHe glanced quickly round and rose to his feet. “I beg your pardon. I\\nthought—”\\n\\n“You thought it was my husband. It is only his wife. You must let me\\nintroduce myself. I know you quite well by your photographs. I think my\\nhusband has got seventeen of them.”\\n\\n“Not seventeen, Lady Henry?”\\n\\n“Well, eighteen, then. And I saw you with him the other night at the\\nopera.” She laughed nervously as she spoke, and watched him with her\\nvague forget-me-not eyes. She was a curious woman, whose dresses always\\nlooked as if they had been designed in a rage and put on in a tempest.\\nShe was usually in love with somebody, and, as her passion was never\\nreturned, she had kept all her illusions. She tried to look\\npicturesque, but only succeeded in being untidy. Her name was Victoria,\\nand she had a perfect mania for going to church.\\n\\n“That was at Lohengrin, Lady Henry, I think?”\\n\\n“Yes; it was at dear Lohengrin. I like Wagner’s music better than\\nanybody’s. It is so loud that one can talk the whole time without other\\npeople hearing what one says. That is a great advantage, don’t you\\nthink so, Mr. Gray?”\\n\\nThe same nervous staccato laugh broke from her thin lips, and her\\nfingers began to play with a long tortoise-shell paper-knife.\\n\\nDorian smiled and shook his head: “I am afraid I don’t think so, Lady\\nHenry. I never talk during music—at least, during good music. If one\\nhears bad music, it is one’s duty to drown it in conversation.”\\n\\n“Ah! that is one of Harry’s views, isn’t it, Mr. Gray? I always hear\\nHarry’s views from his friends. It is the only way I get to know of\\nthem. But you must not think I don’t like good music. I adore it, but I\\nam afraid of it. It makes me too romantic. I have simply worshipped\\npianists—two at a time, sometimes, Harry tells me. I don’t know what it\\nis about them. Perhaps it is that they are foreigners. They all are,\\nain’t they? Even those that are born in England become foreigners after\\na time, don’t they? It is so clever of them, and such a compliment to\\nart. Makes it quite cosmopolitan, doesn’t it? You have never been to\\nany of my parties, have you, Mr. Gray? You must come. I can’t afford\\norchids, but I spare no expense in foreigners. They make one’s rooms\\nlook so picturesque. But here is Harry! Harry, I came in to look for\\nyou, to ask you something—I forget what it was—and I found Mr. Gray\\nhere. We have had such a pleasant chat about music. We have quite the\\nsame ideas. No; I think our ideas are quite different. But he has been\\nmost pleasant. I am so glad I’ve seen him.”\\n\\n“I am charmed, my love, quite charmed,” said Lord Henry, elevating his\\ndark, crescent-shaped eyebrows and looking at them both with an amused\\nsmile. “So sorry I am late, Dorian. I went to look after a piece of old\\nbrocade in Wardour Street and had to bargain for hours for it. Nowadays\\npeople know the price of everything and the value of nothing.”\\n\\n“I am afraid I must be going,” exclaimed Lady Henry, breaking an\\nawkward silence with her silly sudden laugh. “I have promised to drive\\nwith the duchess. Good-bye, Mr. Gray. Good-bye, Harry. You are dining\\nout, I suppose? So am I. Perhaps I shall see you at Lady Thornbury’s.”\\n\\n“I dare say, my dear,” said Lord Henry, shutting the door behind her\\nas, looking like a bird of paradise that had been out all night in the\\nrain, she flitted out of the room, leaving a faint odour of\\nfrangipanni. Then he lit a cigarette and flung himself down on the\\nsofa.\\n\\n“Never marry a woman with straw-coloured hair, Dorian,” he said after a\\nfew puffs.\\n\\n“Why, Harry?”\\n\\n“Because they are so sentimental.”\\n\\n“But I like sentimental people.”\\n\\n“Never marry at all, Dorian. Men marry because they are tired; women,\\nbecause they are curious: both are disappointed.”\\n\\n“I don’t think I am likely to marry, Harry. I am too much in love. That\\nis one of your aphorisms. I am putting it into practice, as I do\\neverything that you say.”\\n\\n“Who are you in love with?” asked Lord Henry after a pause.\\n\\n“With an actress,” said Dorian Gray, blushing.\\n\\nLord Henry shrugged his shoulders. “That is a rather commonplace\\n_début_.”\\n\\n“You would not say so if you saw her, Harry.”\\n\\n“Who is she?”\\n\\n“Her name is Sibyl Vane.”\\n\\n“Never heard of her.”\\n\\n“No one has. People will some day, however. She is a genius.”\\n\\n“My dear boy, no woman is a genius. Women are a decorative sex. They\\nnever have anything to say, but they say it charmingly. Women represent\\nthe triumph of matter over mind, just as men represent the triumph of\\nmind over morals.”\\n\\n“Harry, how can you?”\\n\\n“My dear Dorian, it is quite true. I am analysing women at present, so\\nI ought to know. The subject is not so abstruse as I thought it was. I\\nfind that, ultimately, there are only two kinds of women, the plain and\\nthe coloured. The plain women are very useful. If you want to gain a\\nreputation for respectability, you have merely to take them down to\\nsupper. The other women are very charming. They commit one mistake,\\nhowever. They paint in order to try and look young. Our grandmothers\\npainted in order to try and talk brilliantly. _Rouge_ and _esprit_ used\\nto go together. That is all over now. As long as a woman can look ten\\nyears younger than her own daughter, she is perfectly satisfied. As for\\nconversation, there are only five women in London worth talking to, and\\ntwo of these can’t be admitted into decent society. However, tell me\\nabout your genius. How long have you known her?”\\n\\n“Ah! Harry, your views terrify me.”\\n\\n“Never mind that. How long have you known her?”\\n\\n“About three weeks.”\\n\\n“And where did you come across her?”\\n\\n“I will tell you, Harry, but you mustn’t be unsympathetic about it.\\nAfter all, it never would have happened if I had not met you. You\\nfilled me with a wild desire to know everything about life. For days\\nafter I met you, something seemed to throb in my veins. As I lounged in\\nthe park, or strolled down Piccadilly, I used to look at every one who\\npassed me and wonder, with a mad curiosity, what sort of lives they\\nled. Some of them fascinated me. Others filled me with terror. There\\nwas an exquisite poison in the air. I had a passion for sensations....\\nWell, one evening about seven o’clock, I determined to go out in search\\nof some adventure. I felt that this grey monstrous London of ours, with\\nits myriads of people, its sordid sinners, and its splendid sins, as\\nyou once phrased it, must have something in store for me. I fancied a\\nthousand things. The mere danger gave me a sense of delight. I\\nremembered what you had said to me on that wonderful evening when we\\nfirst dined together, about the search for beauty being the real secret\\nof life. I don’t know what I expected, but I went out and wandered\\neastward, soon losing my way in a labyrinth of grimy streets and black\\ngrassless squares. About half-past eight I passed by an absurd little\\ntheatre, with great flaring gas-jets and gaudy play-bills. A hideous\\nJew, in the most amazing waistcoat I ever beheld in my life, was\\nstanding at the entrance, smoking a vile cigar. He had greasy ringlets,\\nand an enormous diamond blazed in the centre of a soiled shirt. ‘Have a\\nbox, my Lord?’ he said, when he saw me, and he took off his hat with an\\nair of gorgeous servility. There was something about him, Harry, that\\namused me. He was such a monster. You will laugh at me, I know, but I\\nreally went in and paid a whole guinea for the stage-box. To the\\npresent day I can’t make out why I did so; and yet if I hadn’t—my dear\\nHarry, if I hadn’t—I should have missed the greatest romance of my\\nlife. I see you are laughing. It is horrid of you!”\\n\\n“I am not laughing, Dorian; at least I am not laughing at you. But you\\nshould not say the greatest romance of your life. You should say the\\nfirst romance of your life. You will always be loved, and you will\\nalways be in love with love. A _grande passion_ is the privilege of\\npeople who have nothing to do. That is the one use of the idle classes\\nof a country. Don’t be afraid. There are exquisite things in store for\\nyou. This is merely the beginning.”\\n\\n“Do you think my nature so shallow?” cried Dorian Gray angrily.\\n\\n“No; I think your nature so deep.”\\n\\n“How do you mean?”\\n\\n“My dear boy, the people who love only once in their lives are really\\nthe shallow people. What they call their loyalty, and their fidelity, I\\ncall either the lethargy of custom or their lack of imagination.\\nFaithfulness is to the emotional life what consistency is to the life\\nof the intellect—simply a confession of failure. Faithfulness! I must\\nanalyse it some day. The passion for property is in it. There are many\\nthings that we would throw away if we were not afraid that others might\\npick them up. But I don’t want to interrupt you. Go on with your\\nstory.”\\n\\n“Well, I found myself seated in a horrid little private box, with a\\nvulgar drop-scene staring me in the face. I looked out from behind the\\ncurtain and surveyed the house. It was a tawdry affair, all Cupids and\\ncornucopias, like a third-rate wedding-cake. The gallery and pit were\\nfairly full, but the two rows of dingy stalls were quite empty, and\\nthere was hardly a person in what I suppose they called the\\ndress-circle. Women went about with oranges and ginger-beer, and there\\nwas a terrible consumption of nuts going on.”\\n\\n“It must have been just like the palmy days of the British drama.”\\n\\n“Just like, I should fancy, and very depressing. I began to wonder what\\non earth I should do when I caught sight of the play-bill. What do you\\nthink the play was, Harry?”\\n\\n“I should think ‘The Idiot Boy’, or ‘Dumb but Innocent’. Our fathers\\nused to like that sort of piece, I believe. The longer I live, Dorian,\\nthe more keenly I feel that whatever was good enough for our fathers is\\nnot good enough for us. In art, as in politics, _les grandpères ont\\ntoujours tort_.”\\n\\n“This play was good enough for us, Harry. It was Romeo and Juliet. I\\nmust admit that I was rather annoyed at the idea of seeing Shakespeare\\ndone in such a wretched hole of a place. Still, I felt interested, in a\\nsort of way. At any rate, I determined to wait for the first act. There\\nwas a dreadful orchestra, presided over by a young Hebrew who sat at a\\ncracked piano, that nearly drove me away, but at last the drop-scene\\nwas drawn up and the play began. Romeo was a stout elderly gentleman,\\nwith corked eyebrows, a husky tragedy voice, and a figure like a\\nbeer-barrel. Mercutio was almost as bad. He was played by the\\nlow-comedian, who had introduced gags of his own and was on most\\nfriendly terms with the pit. They were both as grotesque as the\\nscenery, and that looked as if it had come out of a country-booth. But\\nJuliet! Harry, imagine a girl, hardly seventeen years of age, with a\\nlittle, flowerlike face, a small Greek head with plaited coils of\\ndark-brown hair, eyes that were violet wells of passion, lips that were\\nlike the petals of a rose. She was the loveliest thing I had ever seen\\nin my life. You said to me once that pathos left you unmoved, but that\\nbeauty, mere beauty, could fill your eyes with tears. I tell you,\\nHarry, I could hardly see this girl for the mist of tears that came\\nacross me. And her voice—I never heard such a voice. It was very low at\\nfirst, with deep mellow notes that seemed to fall singly upon one’s\\near. Then it became a little louder, and sounded like a flute or a\\ndistant hautboy. In the garden-scene it had all the tremulous ecstasy\\nthat one hears just before dawn when nightingales are singing. There\\nwere moments, later on, when it had the wild passion of violins. You\\nknow how a voice can stir one. Your voice and the voice of Sibyl Vane\\nare two things that I shall never forget. When I close my eyes, I hear\\nthem, and each of them says something different. I don’t know which to\\nfollow. Why should I not love her? Harry, I do love her. She is\\neverything to me in life. Night after night I go to see her play. One\\nevening she is Rosalind, and the next evening she is Imogen. I have\\nseen her die in the gloom of an Italian tomb, sucking the poison from\\nher lover’s lips. I have watched her wandering through the forest of\\nArden, disguised as a pretty boy in hose and doublet and dainty cap.\\nShe has been mad, and has come into the presence of a guilty king, and\\ngiven him rue to wear and bitter herbs to taste of. She has been\\ninnocent, and the black hands of jealousy have crushed her reedlike\\nthroat. I have seen her in every age and in every costume. Ordinary\\nwomen never appeal to one’s imagination. They are limited to their\\ncentury. No glamour ever transfigures them. One knows their minds as\\neasily as one knows their bonnets. One can always find them. There is\\nno mystery in any of them. They ride in the park in the morning and\\nchatter at tea-parties in the afternoon. They have their stereotyped\\nsmile and their fashionable manner. They are quite obvious. But an\\nactress! How different an actress is! Harry! why didn’t you tell me\\nthat the only thing worth loving is an actress?”\\n\\n“Because I have loved so many of them, Dorian.”\\n\\n“Oh, yes, horrid people with dyed hair and painted faces.”\\n\\n“Don’t run down dyed hair and painted faces. There is an extraordinary\\ncharm in them, sometimes,” said Lord Henry.\\n\\n“I wish now I had not told you about Sibyl Vane.”\\n\\n“You could not have helped telling me, Dorian. All through your life\\nyou will tell me everything you do.”\\n\\n“Yes, Harry, I believe that is true. I cannot help telling you things.\\nYou have a curious influence over me. If I ever did a crime, I would\\ncome and confess it to you. You would understand me.”\\n\\n“People like you—the wilful sunbeams of life—don’t commit crimes,\\nDorian. But I am much obliged for the compliment, all the same. And now\\ntell me—reach me the matches, like a good boy—thanks—what are your\\nactual relations with Sibyl Vane?”\\n\\nDorian Gray leaped to his feet, with flushed cheeks and burning eyes.\\n“Harry! Sibyl Vane is sacred!”\\n\\n“It is only the sacred things that are worth touching, Dorian,” said\\nLord Henry, with a strange touch of pathos in his voice. “But why\\nshould you be annoyed? I suppose she will belong to you some day. When\\none is in love, one always begins by deceiving one’s self, and one\\nalways ends by deceiving others. That is what the world calls a\\nromance. You know her, at any rate, I suppose?”\\n\\n“Of course I know her. On the first night I was at the theatre, the\\nhorrid old Jew came round to the box after the performance was over and\\noffered to take me behind the scenes and introduce me to her. I was\\nfurious with him, and told him that Juliet had been dead for hundreds\\nof years and that her body was lying in a marble tomb in Verona. I\\nthink, from his blank look of amazement, that he was under the\\nimpression that I had taken too much champagne, or something.”\\n\\n“I am not surprised.”\\n\\n“Then he asked me if I wrote for any of the newspapers. I told him I\\nnever even read them. He seemed terribly disappointed at that, and\\nconfided to me that all the dramatic critics were in a conspiracy\\nagainst him, and that they were every one of them to be bought.”\\n\\n“I should not wonder if he was quite right there. But, on the other\\nhand, judging from their appearance, most of them cannot be at all\\nexpensive.”\\n\\n“Well, he seemed to think they were beyond his means,” laughed Dorian.\\n“By this time, however, the lights were being put out in the theatre,\\nand I had to go. He wanted me to try some cigars that he strongly\\nrecommended. I declined. The next night, of course, I arrived at the\\nplace again. When he saw me, he made me a low bow and assured me that I\\nwas a munificent patron of art. He was a most offensive brute, though\\nhe had an extraordinary passion for Shakespeare. He told me once, with\\nan air of pride, that his five bankruptcies were entirely due to ‘The\\nBard,’ as he insisted on calling him. He seemed to think it a\\ndistinction.”\\n\\n“It was a distinction, my dear Dorian—a great distinction. Most people\\nbecome bankrupt through having invested too heavily in the prose of\\nlife. To have ruined one’s self over poetry is an honour. But when did\\nyou first speak to Miss Sibyl Vane?”\\n\\n“The third night. She had been playing Rosalind. I could not help going\\nround. I had thrown her some flowers, and she had looked at me—at least\\nI fancied that she had. The old Jew was persistent. He seemed\\ndetermined to take me behind, so I consented. It was curious my not\\nwanting to know her, wasn’t it?”\\n\\n“No; I don’t think so.”\\n\\n“My dear Harry, why?”\\n\\n“I will tell you some other time. Now I want to know about the girl.”\\n\\n“Sibyl? Oh, she was so shy and so gentle. There is something of a child\\nabout her. Her eyes opened wide in exquisite wonder when I told her\\nwhat I thought of her performance, and she seemed quite unconscious of\\nher power. I think we were both rather nervous. The old Jew stood\\ngrinning at the doorway of the dusty greenroom, making elaborate\\nspeeches about us both, while we stood looking at each other like\\nchildren. He would insist on calling me ‘My Lord,’ so I had to assure\\nSibyl that I was not anything of the kind. She said quite simply to me,\\n‘You look more like a prince. I must call you Prince Charming.’”\\n\\n“Upon my word, Dorian, Miss Sibyl knows how to pay compliments.”\\n\\n“You don’t understand her, Harry. She regarded me merely as a person in\\na play. She knows nothing of life. She lives with her mother, a faded\\ntired woman who played Lady Capulet in a sort of magenta\\ndressing-wrapper on the first night, and looks as if she had seen\\nbetter days.”\\n\\n“I know that look. It depresses me,” murmured Lord Henry, examining his\\nrings.\\n\\n“The Jew wanted to tell me her history, but I said it did not interest\\nme.”\\n\\n“You were quite right. There is always something infinitely mean about\\nother people’s tragedies.”\\n\\n“Sibyl is the only thing I care about. What is it to me where she came\\nfrom? From her little head to her little feet, she is absolutely and\\nentirely divine. Every night of my life I go to see her act, and every\\nnight she is more marvellous.”\\n\\n“That is the reason, I suppose, that you never dine with me now. I\\nthought you must have some curious romance on hand. You have; but it is\\nnot quite what I expected.”\\n\\n“My dear Harry, we either lunch or sup together every day, and I have\\nbeen to the opera with you several times,” said Dorian, opening his\\nblue eyes in wonder.\\n\\n“You always come dreadfully late.”\\n\\n“Well, I can’t help going to see Sibyl play,” he cried, “even if it is\\nonly for a single act. I get hungry for her presence; and when I think\\nof the wonderful soul that is hidden away in that little ivory body, I\\nam filled with awe.”\\n\\n“You can dine with me to-night, Dorian, can’t you?”\\n\\nHe shook his head. “To-night she is Imogen,” he answered, “and\\nto-morrow night she will be Juliet.”\\n\\n“When is she Sibyl Vane?”\\n\\n“Never.”\\n\\n“I congratulate you.”\\n\\n“How horrid you are! She is all the great heroines of the world in one.\\nShe is more than an individual. You laugh, but I tell you she has\\ngenius. I love her, and I must make her love me. You, who know all the\\nsecrets of life, tell me how to charm Sibyl Vane to love me! I want to\\nmake Romeo jealous. I want the dead lovers of the world to hear our\\nlaughter and grow sad. I want a breath of our passion to stir their\\ndust into consciousness, to wake their ashes into pain. My God, Harry,\\nhow I worship her!” He was walking up and down the room as he spoke.\\nHectic spots of red burned on his cheeks. He was terribly excited.\\n\\nLord Henry watched him with a subtle sense of pleasure. How different\\nhe was now from the shy frightened boy he had met in Basil Hallward’s\\nstudio! His nature had developed like a flower, had borne blossoms of\\nscarlet flame. Out of its secret hiding-place had crept his soul, and\\ndesire had come to meet it on the way.\\n\\n“And what do you propose to do?” said Lord Henry at last.\\n\\n“I want you and Basil to come with me some night and see her act. I\\nhave not the slightest fear of the result. You are certain to\\nacknowledge her genius. Then we must get her out of the Jew’s hands.\\nShe is bound to him for three years—at least for two years and eight\\nmonths—from the present time. I shall have to pay him something, of\\ncourse. When all that is settled, I shall take a West End theatre and\\nbring her out properly. She will make the world as mad as she has made\\nme.”\\n\\n“That would be impossible, my dear boy.”\\n\\n“Yes, she will. She has not merely art, consummate art-instinct, in\\nher, but she has personality also; and you have often told me that it\\nis personalities, not principles, that move the age.”\\n\\n“Well, what night shall we go?”\\n\\n“Let me see. To-day is Tuesday. Let us fix to-morrow. She plays Juliet\\nto-morrow.”\\n\\n“All right. The Bristol at eight o’clock; and I will get Basil.”\\n\\n“Not eight, Harry, please. Half-past six. We must be there before the\\ncurtain rises. You must see her in the first act, where she meets\\nRomeo.”\\n\\n“Half-past six! What an hour! It will be like having a meat-tea, or\\nreading an English novel. It must be seven. No gentleman dines before\\nseven. Shall you see Basil between this and then? Or shall I write to\\nhim?”\\n\\n“Dear Basil! I have not laid eyes on him for a week. It is rather\\nhorrid of me, as he has sent me my portrait in the most wonderful\\nframe, specially designed by himself, and, though I am a little jealous\\nof the picture for being a whole month younger than I am, I must admit\\nthat I delight in it. Perhaps you had better write to him. I don’t want\\nto see him alone. He says things that annoy me. He gives me good\\nadvice.”\\n\\nLord Henry smiled. “People are very fond of giving away what they need\\nmost themselves. It is what I call the depth of generosity.”\\n\\n“Oh, Basil is the best of fellows, but he seems to me to be just a bit\\nof a Philistine. Since I have known you, Harry, I have discovered\\nthat.”\\n\\n“Basil, my dear boy, puts everything that is charming in him into his\\nwork. The consequence is that he has nothing left for life but his\\nprejudices, his principles, and his common sense. The only artists I\\nhave ever known who are personally delightful are bad artists. Good\\nartists exist simply in what they make, and consequently are perfectly\\nuninteresting in what they are. A great poet, a really great poet, is\\nthe most unpoetical of all creatures. But inferior poets are absolutely\\nfascinating. The worse their rhymes are, the more picturesque they\\nlook. The mere fact of having published a book of second-rate sonnets\\nmakes a man quite irresistible. He lives the poetry that he cannot\\nwrite. The others write the poetry that they dare not realize.”\\n\\n“I wonder is that really so, Harry?” said Dorian Gray, putting some\\nperfume on his handkerchief out of a large, gold-topped bottle that\\nstood on the table. “It must be, if you say it. And now I am off.\\nImogen is waiting for me. Don’t forget about to-morrow. Good-bye.”\\n\\nAs he left the room, Lord Henry’s heavy eyelids drooped, and he began\\nto think. Certainly few people had ever interested him so much as\\nDorian Gray, and yet the lad’s mad adoration of some one else caused\\nhim not the slightest pang of annoyance or jealousy. He was pleased by\\nit. It made him a more interesting study. He had been always enthralled\\nby the methods of natural science, but the ordinary subject-matter of\\nthat science had seemed to him trivial and of no import. And so he had\\nbegun by vivisecting himself, as he had ended by vivisecting others.\\nHuman life—that appeared to him the one thing worth investigating.\\nCompared to it there was nothing else of any value. It was true that as\\none watched life in its curious crucible of pain and pleasure, one\\ncould not wear over one’s face a mask of glass, nor keep the sulphurous\\nfumes from troubling the brain and making the imagination turbid with\\nmonstrous fancies and misshapen dreams. There were poisons so subtle\\nthat to know their properties one had to sicken of them. There were\\nmaladies so strange that one had to pass through them if one sought to\\nunderstand their nature. And, yet, what a great reward one received!\\nHow wonderful the whole world became to one! To note the curious hard\\nlogic of passion, and the emotional coloured life of the intellect—to\\nobserve where they met, and where they separated, at what point they\\nwere in unison, and at what point they were at discord—there was a\\ndelight in that! What matter what the cost was? One could never pay too\\nhigh a price for any sensation.\\n\\nHe was conscious—and the thought brought a gleam of pleasure into his\\nbrown agate eyes—that it was through certain words of his, musical\\nwords said with musical utterance, that Dorian Gray’s soul had turned\\nto this white girl and bowed in worship before her. To a large extent\\nthe lad was his own creation. He had made him premature. That was\\nsomething. Ordinary people waited till life disclosed to them its\\nsecrets, but to the few, to the elect, the mysteries of life were\\nrevealed before the veil was drawn away. Sometimes this was the effect\\nof art, and chiefly of the art of literature, which dealt immediately\\nwith the passions and the intellect. But now and then a complex\\npersonality took the place and assumed the office of art, was indeed,\\nin its way, a real work of art, life having its elaborate masterpieces,\\njust as poetry has, or sculpture, or painting.\\n\\nYes, the lad was premature. He was gathering his harvest while it was\\nyet spring. The pulse and passion of youth were in him, but he was\\nbecoming self-conscious. It was delightful to watch him. With his\\nbeautiful face, and his beautiful soul, he was a thing to wonder at. It\\nwas no matter how it all ended, or was destined to end. He was like one\\nof those gracious figures in a pageant or a play, whose joys seem to be\\nremote from one, but whose sorrows stir one’s sense of beauty, and\\nwhose wounds are like red roses.\\n\\nSoul and body, body and soul—how mysterious they were! There was\\nanimalism in the soul, and the body had its moments of spirituality.\\nThe senses could refine, and the intellect could degrade. Who could say\\nwhere the fleshly impulse ceased, or the psychical impulse began? How\\nshallow were the arbitrary definitions of ordinary psychologists! And\\nyet how difficult to decide between the claims of the various schools!\\nWas the soul a shadow seated in the house of sin? Or was the body\\nreally in the soul, as Giordano Bruno thought? The separation of spirit\\nfrom matter was a mystery, and the union of spirit with matter was a\\nmystery also.\\n\\nHe began to wonder whether we could ever make psychology so absolute a\\nscience that each little spring of life would be revealed to us. As it\\nwas, we always misunderstood ourselves and rarely understood others.\\nExperience was of no ethical value. It was merely the name men gave to\\ntheir mistakes. Moralists had, as a rule, regarded it as a mode of\\nwarning, had claimed for it a certain ethical efficacy in the formation\\nof character, had praised it as something that taught us what to follow\\nand showed us what to avoid. But there was no motive power in\\nexperience. It was as little of an active cause as conscience itself.\\nAll that it really demonstrated was that our future would be the same\\nas our past, and that the sin we had done once, and with loathing, we\\nwould do many times, and with joy.\\n\\nIt was clear to him that the experimental method was the only method by\\nwhich one could arrive at any scientific analysis of the passions; and\\ncertainly Dorian Gray was a subject made to his hand, and seemed to\\npromise rich and fruitful results. His sudden mad love for Sibyl Vane\\nwas a psychological phenomenon of no small interest. There was no doubt\\nthat curiosity had much to do with it, curiosity and the desire for new\\nexperiences, yet it was not a simple, but rather a very complex\\npassion. What there was in it of the purely sensuous instinct of\\nboyhood had been transformed by the workings of the imagination,\\nchanged into something that seemed to the lad himself to be remote from\\nsense, and was for that very reason all the more dangerous. It was the\\npassions about whose origin we deceived ourselves that tyrannized most\\nstrongly over us. Our weakest motives were those of whose nature we\\nwere conscious. It often happened that when we thought we were\\nexperimenting on others we were really experimenting on ourselves.\\n\\nWhile Lord Henry sat dreaming on these things, a knock came to the\\ndoor, and his valet entered and reminded him it was time to dress for\\ndinner. He got up and looked out into the street. The sunset had\\nsmitten into scarlet gold the upper windows of the houses opposite. The\\npanes glowed like plates of heated metal. The sky above was like a\\nfaded rose. He thought of his friend’s young fiery-coloured life and\\nwondered how it was all going to end.\\n\\nWhen he arrived home, about half-past twelve o’clock, he saw a telegram\\nlying on the hall table. He opened it and found it was from Dorian\\nGray. It was to tell him that he was engaged to be married to Sibyl\\nVane.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V.\\n\\n\\n“Mother, Mother, I am so happy!” whispered the girl, burying her face\\nin the lap of the faded, tired-looking woman who, with back turned to\\nthe shrill intrusive light, was sitting in the one arm-chair that their\\ndingy sitting-room contained. “I am so happy!” she repeated, “and you\\nmust be happy, too!”\\n\\nMrs. Vane winced and put her thin, bismuth-whitened hands on her\\ndaughter’s head. “Happy!” she echoed, “I am only happy, Sibyl, when I\\nsee you act. You must not think of anything but your acting. Mr. Isaacs\\nhas been very good to us, and we owe him money.”\\n\\nThe girl looked up and pouted. “Money, Mother?” she cried, “what does\\nmoney matter? Love is more than money.”\\n\\n“Mr. Isaacs has advanced us fifty pounds to pay off our debts and to\\nget a proper outfit for James. You must not forget that, Sibyl. Fifty\\npounds is a very large sum. Mr. Isaacs has been most considerate.”\\n\\n“He is not a gentleman, Mother, and I hate the way he talks to me,”\\nsaid the girl, rising to her feet and going over to the window.\\n\\n“I don’t know how we could manage without him,” answered the elder\\nwoman querulously.\\n\\nSibyl Vane tossed her head and laughed. “We don’t want him any more,\\nMother. Prince Charming rules life for us now.” Then she paused. A rose\\nshook in her blood and shadowed her cheeks. Quick breath parted the\\npetals of her lips. They trembled. Some southern wind of passion swept\\nover her and stirred the dainty folds of her dress. “I love him,” she\\nsaid simply.\\n\\n“Foolish child! foolish child!” was the parrot-phrase flung in answer.\\nThe waving of crooked, false-jewelled fingers gave grotesqueness to the\\nwords.\\n\\nThe girl laughed again. The joy of a caged bird was in her voice. Her\\neyes caught the melody and echoed it in radiance, then closed for a\\nmoment, as though to hide their secret. When they opened, the mist of a\\ndream had passed across them.\\n\\nThin-lipped wisdom spoke at her from the worn chair, hinted at\\nprudence, quoted from that book of cowardice whose author apes the name\\nof common sense. She did not listen. She was free in her prison of\\npassion. Her prince, Prince Charming, was with her. She had called on\\nmemory to remake him. She had sent her soul to search for him, and it\\nhad brought him back. His kiss burned again upon her mouth. Her eyelids\\nwere warm with his breath.\\n\\nThen wisdom altered its method and spoke of espial and discovery. This\\nyoung man might be rich. If so, marriage should be thought of. Against\\nthe shell of her ear broke the waves of worldly cunning. The arrows of\\ncraft shot by her. She saw the thin lips moving, and smiled.\\n\\nSuddenly she felt the need to speak. The wordy silence troubled her.\\n“Mother, Mother,” she cried, “why does he love me so much? I know why I\\nlove him. I love him because he is like what love himself should be.\\nBut what does he see in me? I am not worthy of him. And yet—why, I\\ncannot tell—though I feel so much beneath him, I don’t feel humble. I\\nfeel proud, terribly proud. Mother, did you love my father as I love\\nPrince Charming?”\\n\\nThe elder woman grew pale beneath the coarse powder that daubed her\\ncheeks, and her dry lips twitched with a spasm of pain. Sybil rushed to\\nher, flung her arms round her neck, and kissed her. “Forgive me,\\nMother. I know it pains you to talk about our father. But it only pains\\nyou because you loved him so much. Don’t look so sad. I am as happy\\nto-day as you were twenty years ago. Ah! let me be happy for ever!”\\n\\n“My child, you are far too young to think of falling in love. Besides,\\nwhat do you know of this young man? You don’t even know his name. The\\nwhole thing is most inconvenient, and really, when James is going away\\nto Australia, and I have so much to think of, I must say that you\\nshould have shown more consideration. However, as I said before, if he\\nis rich ...”\\n\\n“Ah! Mother, Mother, let me be happy!”\\n\\nMrs. Vane glanced at her, and with one of those false theatrical\\ngestures that so often become a mode of second nature to a\\nstage-player, clasped her in her arms. At this moment, the door opened\\nand a young lad with rough brown hair came into the room. He was\\nthick-set of figure, and his hands and feet were large and somewhat\\nclumsy in movement. He was not so finely bred as his sister. One would\\nhardly have guessed the close relationship that existed between them.\\nMrs. Vane fixed her eyes on him and intensified her smile. She mentally\\nelevated her son to the dignity of an audience. She felt sure that the\\n_tableau_ was interesting.\\n\\n“You might keep some of your kisses for me, Sibyl, I think,” said the\\nlad with a good-natured grumble.\\n\\n“Ah! but you don’t like being kissed, Jim,” she cried. “You are a\\ndreadful old bear.” And she ran across the room and hugged him.\\n\\nJames Vane looked into his sister’s face with tenderness. “I want you\\nto come out with me for a walk, Sibyl. I don’t suppose I shall ever see\\nthis horrid London again. I am sure I don’t want to.”\\n\\n“My son, don’t say such dreadful things,” murmured Mrs. Vane, taking up\\na tawdry theatrical dress, with a sigh, and beginning to patch it. She\\nfelt a little disappointed that he had not joined the group. It would\\nhave increased the theatrical picturesqueness of the situation.\\n\\n“Why not, Mother? I mean it.”\\n\\n“You pain me, my son. I trust you will return from Australia in a\\nposition of affluence. I believe there is no society of any kind in the\\nColonies—nothing that I would call society—so when you have made your\\nfortune, you must come back and assert yourself in London.”\\n\\n“Society!” muttered the lad. “I don’t want to know anything about that.\\nI should like to make some money to take you and Sibyl off the stage. I\\nhate it.”\\n\\n“Oh, Jim!” said Sibyl, laughing, “how unkind of you! But are you really\\ngoing for a walk with me? That will be nice! I was afraid you were\\ngoing to say good-bye to some of your friends—to Tom Hardy, who gave\\nyou that hideous pipe, or Ned Langton, who makes fun of you for smoking\\nit. It is very sweet of you to let me have your last afternoon. Where\\nshall we go? Let us go to the park.”\\n\\n“I am too shabby,” he answered, frowning. “Only swell people go to the\\npark.”\\n\\n“Nonsense, Jim,” she whispered, stroking the sleeve of his coat.\\n\\nHe hesitated for a moment. “Very well,” he said at last, “but don’t be\\ntoo long dressing.” She danced out of the door. One could hear her\\nsinging as she ran upstairs. Her little feet pattered overhead.\\n\\nHe walked up and down the room two or three times. Then he turned to\\nthe still figure in the chair. “Mother, are my things ready?” he asked.\\n\\n“Quite ready, James,” she answered, keeping her eyes on her work. For\\nsome months past she had felt ill at ease when she was alone with this\\nrough stern son of hers. Her shallow secret nature was troubled when\\ntheir eyes met. She used to wonder if he suspected anything. The\\nsilence, for he made no other observation, became intolerable to her.\\nShe began to complain. Women defend themselves by attacking, just as\\nthey attack by sudden and strange surrenders. “I hope you will be\\ncontented, James, with your sea-faring life,” she said. “You must\\nremember that it is your own choice. You might have entered a\\nsolicitor’s office. Solicitors are a very respectable class, and in the\\ncountry often dine with the best families.”\\n\\n“I hate offices, and I hate clerks,” he replied. “But you are quite\\nright. I have chosen my own life. All I say is, watch over Sibyl. Don’t\\nlet her come to any harm. Mother, you must watch over her.”\\n\\n“James, you really talk very strangely. Of course I watch over Sibyl.”\\n\\n“I hear a gentleman comes every night to the theatre and goes behind to\\ntalk to her. Is that right? What about that?”\\n\\n“You are speaking about things you don’t understand, James. In the\\nprofession we are accustomed to receive a great deal of most gratifying\\nattention. I myself used to receive many bouquets at one time. That was\\nwhen acting was really understood. As for Sibyl, I do not know at\\npresent whether her attachment is serious or not. But there is no doubt\\nthat the young man in question is a perfect gentleman. He is always\\nmost polite to me. Besides, he has the appearance of being rich, and\\nthe flowers he sends are lovely.”\\n\\n“You don’t know his name, though,” said the lad harshly.\\n\\n“No,” answered his mother with a placid expression in her face. “He has\\nnot yet revealed his real name. I think it is quite romantic of him. He\\nis probably a member of the aristocracy.”\\n\\nJames Vane bit his lip. “Watch over Sibyl, Mother,” he cried, “watch\\nover her.”\\n\\n“My son, you distress me very much. Sibyl is always under my special\\ncare. Of course, if this gentleman is wealthy, there is no reason why\\nshe should not contract an alliance with him. I trust he is one of the\\naristocracy. He has all the appearance of it, I must say. It might be a\\nmost brilliant marriage for Sibyl. They would make a charming couple.\\nHis good looks are really quite remarkable; everybody notices them.”\\n\\nThe lad muttered something to himself and drummed on the window-pane\\nwith his coarse fingers. He had just turned round to say something when\\nthe door opened and Sibyl ran in.\\n\\n“How serious you both are!” she cried. “What is the matter?”\\n\\n“Nothing,” he answered. “I suppose one must be serious sometimes.\\nGood-bye, Mother; I will have my dinner at five o’clock. Everything is\\npacked, except my shirts, so you need not trouble.”\\n\\n“Good-bye, my son,” she answered with a bow of strained stateliness.\\n\\nShe was extremely annoyed at the tone he had adopted with her, and\\nthere was something in his look that had made her feel afraid.\\n\\n“Kiss me, Mother,” said the girl. Her flowerlike lips touched the\\nwithered cheek and warmed its frost.\\n\\n“My child! my child!” cried Mrs. Vane, looking up to the ceiling in\\nsearch of an imaginary gallery.\\n\\n“Come, Sibyl,” said her brother impatiently. He hated his mother’s\\naffectations.\\n\\nThey went out into the flickering, wind-blown sunlight and strolled\\ndown the dreary Euston Road. The passersby glanced in wonder at the\\nsullen heavy youth who, in coarse, ill-fitting clothes, was in the\\ncompany of such a graceful, refined-looking girl. He was like a common\\ngardener walking with a rose.\\n\\nJim frowned from time to time when he caught the inquisitive glance of\\nsome stranger. He had that dislike of being stared at, which comes on\\ngeniuses late in life and never leaves the commonplace. Sibyl, however,\\nwas quite unconscious of the effect she was producing. Her love was\\ntrembling in laughter on her lips. She was thinking of Prince Charming,\\nand, that she might think of him all the more, she did not talk of him,\\nbut prattled on about the ship in which Jim was going to sail, about\\nthe gold he was certain to find, about the wonderful heiress whose life\\nhe was to save from the wicked, red-shirted bushrangers. For he was not\\nto remain a sailor, or a supercargo, or whatever he was going to be.\\nOh, no! A sailor’s existence was dreadful. Fancy being cooped up in a\\nhorrid ship, with the hoarse, hump-backed waves trying to get in, and a\\nblack wind blowing the masts down and tearing the sails into long\\nscreaming ribands! He was to leave the vessel at Melbourne, bid a\\npolite good-bye to the captain, and go off at once to the gold-fields.\\nBefore a week was over he was to come across a large nugget of pure\\ngold, the largest nugget that had ever been discovered, and bring it\\ndown to the coast in a waggon guarded by six mounted policemen. The\\nbushrangers were to attack them three times, and be defeated with\\nimmense slaughter. Or, no. He was not to go to the gold-fields at all.\\nThey were horrid places, where men got intoxicated, and shot each other\\nin bar-rooms, and used bad language. He was to be a nice sheep-farmer,\\nand one evening, as he was riding home, he was to see the beautiful\\nheiress being carried off by a robber on a black horse, and give chase,\\nand rescue her. Of course, she would fall in love with him, and he with\\nher, and they would get married, and come home, and live in an immense\\nhouse in London. Yes, there were delightful things in store for him.\\nBut he must be very good, and not lose his temper, or spend his money\\nfoolishly. She was only a year older than he was, but she knew so much\\nmore of life. He must be sure, also, to write to her by every mail, and\\nto say his prayers each night before he went to sleep. God was very\\ngood, and would watch over him. She would pray for him, too, and in a\\nfew years he would come back quite rich and happy.\\n\\nThe lad listened sulkily to her and made no answer. He was heart-sick\\nat leaving home.\\n\\nYet it was not this alone that made him gloomy and morose.\\nInexperienced though he was, he had still a strong sense of the danger\\nof Sibyl’s position. This young dandy who was making love to her could\\nmean her no good. He was a gentleman, and he hated him for that, hated\\nhim through some curious race-instinct for which he could not account,\\nand which for that reason was all the more dominant within him. He was\\nconscious also of the shallowness and vanity of his mother’s nature,\\nand in that saw infinite peril for Sibyl and Sibyl’s happiness.\\nChildren begin by loving their parents; as they grow older they judge\\nthem; sometimes they forgive them.\\n\\nHis mother! He had something on his mind to ask of her, something that\\nhe had brooded on for many months of silence. A chance phrase that he\\nhad heard at the theatre, a whispered sneer that had reached his ears\\none night as he waited at the stage-door, had set loose a train of\\nhorrible thoughts. He remembered it as if it had been the lash of a\\nhunting-crop across his face. His brows knit together into a wedge-like\\nfurrow, and with a twitch of pain he bit his underlip.\\n\\n“You are not listening to a word I am saying, Jim,” cried Sibyl, “and I\\nam making the most delightful plans for your future. Do say something.”\\n\\n“What do you want me to say?”\\n\\n“Oh! that you will be a good boy and not forget us,” she answered,\\nsmiling at him.\\n\\nHe shrugged his shoulders. “You are more likely to forget me than I am\\nto forget you, Sibyl.”\\n\\nShe flushed. “What do you mean, Jim?” she asked.\\n\\n“You have a new friend, I hear. Who is he? Why have you not told me\\nabout him? He means you no good.”\\n\\n“Stop, Jim!” she exclaimed. “You must not say anything against him. I\\nlove him.”\\n\\n“Why, you don’t even know his name,” answered the lad. “Who is he? I\\nhave a right to know.”\\n\\n“He is called Prince Charming. Don’t you like the name. Oh! you silly\\nboy! you should never forget it. If you only saw him, you would think\\nhim the most wonderful person in the world. Some day you will meet\\nhim—when you come back from Australia. You will like him so much.\\nEverybody likes him, and I ... love him. I wish you could come to the\\ntheatre to-night. He is going to be there, and I am to play Juliet. Oh!\\nhow I shall play it! Fancy, Jim, to be in love and play Juliet! To have\\nhim sitting there! To play for his delight! I am afraid I may frighten\\nthe company, frighten or enthrall them. To be in love is to surpass\\none’s self. Poor dreadful Mr. Isaacs will be shouting ‘genius’ to his\\nloafers at the bar. He has preached me as a dogma; to-night he will\\nannounce me as a revelation. I feel it. And it is all his, his only,\\nPrince Charming, my wonderful lover, my god of graces. But I am poor\\nbeside him. Poor? What does that matter? When poverty creeps in at the\\ndoor, love flies in through the window. Our proverbs want rewriting.\\nThey were made in winter, and it is summer now; spring-time for me, I\\nthink, a very dance of blossoms in blue skies.”\\n\\n“He is a gentleman,” said the lad sullenly.\\n\\n“A prince!” she cried musically. “What more do you want?”\\n\\n“He wants to enslave you.”\\n\\n“I shudder at the thought of being free.”\\n\\n“I want you to beware of him.”\\n\\n“To see him is to worship him; to know him is to trust him.”\\n\\n“Sibyl, you are mad about him.”\\n\\nShe laughed and took his arm. “You dear old Jim, you talk as if you\\nwere a hundred. Some day you will be in love yourself. Then you will\\nknow what it is. Don’t look so sulky. Surely you should be glad to\\nthink that, though you are going away, you leave me happier than I have\\never been before. Life has been hard for us both, terribly hard and\\ndifficult. But it will be different now. You are going to a new world,\\nand I have found one. Here are two chairs; let us sit down and see the\\nsmart people go by.”\\n\\nThey took their seats amidst a crowd of watchers. The tulip-beds across\\nthe road flamed like throbbing rings of fire. A white dust—tremulous\\ncloud of orris-root it seemed—hung in the panting air. The brightly\\ncoloured parasols danced and dipped like monstrous butterflies.\\n\\nShe made her brother talk of himself, his hopes, his prospects. He\\nspoke slowly and with effort. They passed words to each other as\\nplayers at a game pass counters. Sibyl felt oppressed. She could not\\ncommunicate her joy. A faint smile curving that sullen mouth was all\\nthe echo she could win. After some time she became silent. Suddenly she\\ncaught a glimpse of golden hair and laughing lips, and in an open\\ncarriage with two ladies Dorian Gray drove past.\\n\\nShe started to her feet. “There he is!” she cried.\\n\\n“Who?” said Jim Vane.\\n\\n“Prince Charming,” she answered, looking after the victoria.\\n\\nHe jumped up and seized her roughly by the arm. “Show him to me. Which\\nis he? Point him out. I must see him!” he exclaimed; but at that moment\\nthe Duke of Berwick’s four-in-hand came between, and when it had left\\nthe space clear, the carriage had swept out of the park.\\n\\n“He is gone,” murmured Sibyl sadly. “I wish you had seen him.”\\n\\n“I wish I had, for as sure as there is a God in heaven, if he ever does\\nyou any wrong, I shall kill him.”\\n\\nShe looked at him in horror. He repeated his words. They cut the air\\nlike a dagger. The people round began to gape. A lady standing close to\\nher tittered.\\n\\n“Come away, Jim; come away,” she whispered. He followed her doggedly as\\nshe passed through the crowd. He felt glad at what he had said.\\n\\nWhen they reached the Achilles Statue, she turned round. There was pity\\nin her eyes that became laughter on her lips. She shook her head at\\nhim. “You are foolish, Jim, utterly foolish; a bad-tempered boy, that\\nis all. How can you say such horrible things? You don’t know what you\\nare talking about. You are simply jealous and unkind. Ah! I wish you\\nwould fall in love. Love makes people good, and what you said was\\nwicked.”\\n\\n“I am sixteen,” he answered, “and I know what I am about. Mother is no\\nhelp to you. She doesn’t understand how to look after you. I wish now\\nthat I was not going to Australia at all. I have a great mind to chuck\\nthe whole thing up. I would, if my articles hadn’t been signed.”\\n\\n“Oh, don’t be so serious, Jim. You are like one of the heroes of those\\nsilly melodramas Mother used to be so fond of acting in. I am not going\\nto quarrel with you. I have seen him, and oh! to see him is perfect\\nhappiness. We won’t quarrel. I know you would never harm any one I\\nlove, would you?”\\n\\n“Not as long as you love him, I suppose,” was the sullen answer.\\n\\n“I shall love him for ever!” she cried.\\n\\n“And he?”\\n\\n“For ever, too!”\\n\\n“He had better.”\\n\\nShe shrank from him. Then she laughed and put her hand on his arm. He\\nwas merely a boy.\\n\\nAt the Marble Arch they hailed an omnibus, which left them close to\\ntheir shabby home in the Euston Road. It was after five o’clock, and\\nSibyl had to lie down for a couple of hours before acting. Jim insisted\\nthat she should do so. He said that he would sooner part with her when\\ntheir mother was not present. She would be sure to make a scene, and he\\ndetested scenes of every kind.\\n\\nIn Sybil’s own room they parted. There was jealousy in the lad’s heart,\\nand a fierce murderous hatred of the stranger who, as it seemed to him,\\nhad come between them. Yet, when her arms were flung round his neck,\\nand her fingers strayed through his hair, he softened and kissed her\\nwith real affection. There were tears in his eyes as he went\\ndownstairs.\\n\\nHis mother was waiting for him below. She grumbled at his\\nunpunctuality, as he entered. He made no answer, but sat down to his\\nmeagre meal. The flies buzzed round the table and crawled over the\\nstained cloth. Through the rumble of omnibuses, and the clatter of\\nstreet-cabs, he could hear the droning voice devouring each minute that\\nwas left to him.\\n\\nAfter some time, he thrust away his plate and put his head in his\\nhands. He felt that he had a right to know. It should have been told to\\nhim before, if it was as he suspected. Leaden with fear, his mother\\nwatched him. Words dropped mechanically from her lips. A tattered lace\\nhandkerchief twitched in her fingers. When the clock struck six, he got\\nup and went to the door. Then he turned back and looked at her. Their\\neyes met. In hers he saw a wild appeal for mercy. It enraged him.\\n\\n“Mother, I have something to ask you,” he said. Her eyes wandered\\nvaguely about the room. She made no answer. “Tell me the truth. I have\\na right to know. Were you married to my father?”\\n\\nShe heaved a deep sigh. It was a sigh of relief. The terrible moment,\\nthe moment that night and day, for weeks and months, she had dreaded,\\nhad come at last, and yet she felt no terror. Indeed, in some measure\\nit was a disappointment to her. The vulgar directness of the question\\ncalled for a direct answer. The situation had not been gradually led up\\nto. It was crude. It reminded her of a bad rehearsal.\\n\\n“No,” she answered, wondering at the harsh simplicity of life.\\n\\n“My father was a scoundrel then!” cried the lad, clenching his fists.\\n\\nShe shook her head. “I knew he was not free. We loved each other very\\nmuch. If he had lived, he would have made provision for us. Don’t speak\\nagainst him, my son. He was your father, and a gentleman. Indeed, he\\nwas highly connected.”\\n\\nAn oath broke from his lips. “I don’t care for myself,” he exclaimed,\\n“but don’t let Sibyl.... It is a gentleman, isn’t it, who is in love\\nwith her, or says he is? Highly connected, too, I suppose.”\\n\\nFor a moment a hideous sense of humiliation came over the woman. Her\\nhead drooped. She wiped her eyes with shaking hands. “Sibyl has a\\nmother,” she murmured; “I had none.”\\n\\nThe lad was touched. He went towards her, and stooping down, he kissed\\nher. “I am sorry if I have pained you by asking about my father,” he\\nsaid, “but I could not help it. I must go now. Good-bye. Don’t forget\\nthat you will have only one child now to look after, and believe me\\nthat if this man wrongs my sister, I will find out who he is, track him\\ndown, and kill him like a dog. I swear it.”\\n\\nThe exaggerated folly of the threat, the passionate gesture that\\naccompanied it, the mad melodramatic words, made life seem more vivid\\nto her. She was familiar with the atmosphere. She breathed more freely,\\nand for the first time for many months she really admired her son. She\\nwould have liked to have continued the scene on the same emotional\\nscale, but he cut her short. Trunks had to be carried down and mufflers\\nlooked for. The lodging-house drudge bustled in and out. There was the\\nbargaining with the cabman. The moment was lost in vulgar details. It\\nwas with a renewed feeling of disappointment that she waved the\\ntattered lace handkerchief from the window, as her son drove away. She\\nwas conscious that a great opportunity had been wasted. She consoled\\nherself by telling Sibyl how desolate she felt her life would be, now\\nthat she had only one child to look after. She remembered the phrase.\\nIt had pleased her. Of the threat she said nothing. It was vividly and\\ndramatically expressed. She felt that they would all laugh at it some\\nday.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI.\\n\\n\\n“I suppose you have heard the news, Basil?” said Lord Henry that\\nevening as Hallward was shown into a little private room at the Bristol\\nwhere dinner had been laid for three.\\n\\n“No, Harry,” answered the artist, giving his hat and coat to the bowing\\nwaiter. “What is it? Nothing about politics, I hope! They don’t\\ninterest me. There is hardly a single person in the House of Commons\\nworth painting, though many of them would be the better for a little\\nwhitewashing.”\\n\\n“Dorian Gray is engaged to be married,” said Lord Henry, watching him\\nas he spoke.\\n\\nHallward started and then frowned. “Dorian engaged to be married!” he\\ncried. “Impossible!”\\n\\n“It is perfectly true.”\\n\\n“To whom?”\\n\\n“To some little actress or other.”\\n\\n“I can’t believe it. Dorian is far too sensible.”\\n\\n“Dorian is far too wise not to do foolish things now and then, my dear\\nBasil.”\\n\\n“Marriage is hardly a thing that one can do now and then, Harry.”\\n\\n“Except in America,” rejoined Lord Henry languidly. “But I didn’t say\\nhe was married. I said he was engaged to be married. There is a great\\ndifference. I have a distinct remembrance of being married, but I have\\nno recollection at all of being engaged. I am inclined to think that I\\nnever was engaged.”\\n\\n“But think of Dorian’s birth, and position, and wealth. It would be\\nabsurd for him to marry so much beneath him.”\\n\\n“If you want to make him marry this girl, tell him that, Basil. He is\\nsure to do it, then. Whenever a man does a thoroughly stupid thing, it\\nis always from the noblest motives.”\\n\\n“I hope the girl is good, Harry. I don’t want to see Dorian tied to\\nsome vile creature, who might degrade his nature and ruin his\\nintellect.”\\n\\n“Oh, she is better than good—she is beautiful,” murmured Lord Henry,\\nsipping a glass of vermouth and orange-bitters. “Dorian says she is\\nbeautiful, and he is not often wrong about things of that kind. Your\\nportrait of him has quickened his appreciation of the personal\\nappearance of other people. It has had that excellent effect, amongst\\nothers. We are to see her to-night, if that boy doesn’t forget his\\nappointment.”\\n\\n“Are you serious?”\\n\\n“Quite serious, Basil. I should be miserable if I thought I should ever\\nbe more serious than I am at the present moment.”\\n\\n“But do you approve of it, Harry?” asked the painter, walking up and\\ndown the room and biting his lip. “You can’t approve of it, possibly.\\nIt is some silly infatuation.”\\n\\n“I never approve, or disapprove, of anything now. It is an absurd\\nattitude to take towards life. We are not sent into the world to air\\nour moral prejudices. I never take any notice of what common people\\nsay, and I never interfere with what charming people do. If a\\npersonality fascinates me, whatever mode of expression that personality\\nselects is absolutely delightful to me. Dorian Gray falls in love with\\na beautiful girl who acts Juliet, and proposes to marry her. Why not?\\nIf he wedded Messalina, he would be none the less interesting. You know\\nI am not a champion of marriage. The real drawback to marriage is that\\nit makes one unselfish. And unselfish people are colourless. They lack\\nindividuality. Still, there are certain temperaments that marriage\\nmakes more complex. They retain their egotism, and add to it many other\\negos. They are forced to have more than one life. They become more\\nhighly organized, and to be highly organized is, I should fancy, the\\nobject of man’s existence. Besides, every experience is of value, and\\nwhatever one may say against marriage, it is certainly an experience. I\\nhope that Dorian Gray will make this girl his wife, passionately adore\\nher for six months, and then suddenly become fascinated by some one\\nelse. He would be a wonderful study.”\\n\\n“You don’t mean a single word of all that, Harry; you know you don’t.\\nIf Dorian Gray’s life were spoiled, no one would be sorrier than\\nyourself. You are much better than you pretend to be.”\\n\\nLord Henry laughed. “The reason we all like to think so well of others\\nis that we are all afraid for ourselves. The basis of optimism is sheer\\nterror. We think that we are generous because we credit our neighbour\\nwith the possession of those virtues that are likely to be a benefit to\\nus. We praise the banker that we may overdraw our account, and find\\ngood qualities in the highwayman in the hope that he may spare our\\npockets. I mean everything that I have said. I have the greatest\\ncontempt for optimism. As for a spoiled life, no life is spoiled but\\none whose growth is arrested. If you want to mar a nature, you have\\nmerely to reform it. As for marriage, of course that would be silly,\\nbut there are other and more interesting bonds between men and women. I\\nwill certainly encourage them. They have the charm of being\\nfashionable. But here is Dorian himself. He will tell you more than I\\ncan.”\\n\\n“My dear Harry, my dear Basil, you must both congratulate me!” said the\\nlad, throwing off his evening cape with its satin-lined wings and\\nshaking each of his friends by the hand in turn. “I have never been so\\nhappy. Of course, it is sudden—all really delightful things are. And\\nyet it seems to me to be the one thing I have been looking for all my\\nlife.” He was flushed with excitement and pleasure, and looked\\nextraordinarily handsome.\\n\\n“I hope you will always be very happy, Dorian,” said Hallward, “but I\\ndon’t quite forgive you for not having let me know of your engagement.\\nYou let Harry know.”\\n\\n“And I don’t forgive you for being late for dinner,” broke in Lord\\nHenry, putting his hand on the lad’s shoulder and smiling as he spoke.\\n“Come, let us sit down and try what the new _chef_ here is like, and\\nthen you will tell us how it all came about.”\\n\\n“There is really not much to tell,” cried Dorian as they took their\\nseats at the small round table. “What happened was simply this. After I\\nleft you yesterday evening, Harry, I dressed, had some dinner at that\\nlittle Italian restaurant in Rupert Street you introduced me to, and\\nwent down at eight o’clock to the theatre. Sibyl was playing Rosalind.\\nOf course, the scenery was dreadful and the Orlando absurd. But Sibyl!\\nYou should have seen her! When she came on in her boy’s clothes, she\\nwas perfectly wonderful. She wore a moss-coloured velvet jerkin with\\ncinnamon sleeves, slim, brown, cross-gartered hose, a dainty little\\ngreen cap with a hawk’s feather caught in a jewel, and a hooded cloak\\nlined with dull red. She had never seemed to me more exquisite. She had\\nall the delicate grace of that Tanagra figurine that you have in your\\nstudio, Basil. Her hair clustered round her face like dark leaves round\\na pale rose. As for her acting—well, you shall see her to-night. She is\\nsimply a born artist. I sat in the dingy box absolutely enthralled. I\\nforgot that I was in London and in the nineteenth century. I was away\\nwith my love in a forest that no man had ever seen. After the\\nperformance was over, I went behind and spoke to her. As we were\\nsitting together, suddenly there came into her eyes a look that I had\\nnever seen there before. My lips moved towards hers. We kissed each\\nother. I can’t describe to you what I felt at that moment. It seemed to\\nme that all my life had been narrowed to one perfect point of\\nrose-coloured joy. She trembled all over and shook like a white\\nnarcissus. Then she flung herself on her knees and kissed my hands. I\\nfeel that I should not tell you all this, but I can’t help it. Of\\ncourse, our engagement is a dead secret. She has not even told her own\\nmother. I don’t know what my guardians will say. Lord Radley is sure to\\nbe furious. I don’t care. I shall be of age in less than a year, and\\nthen I can do what I like. I have been right, Basil, haven’t I, to take\\nmy love out of poetry and to find my wife in Shakespeare’s plays? Lips\\nthat Shakespeare taught to speak have whispered their secret in my ear.\\nI have had the arms of Rosalind around me, and kissed Juliet on the\\nmouth.”\\n\\n“Yes, Dorian, I suppose you were right,” said Hallward slowly.\\n\\n“Have you seen her to-day?” asked Lord Henry.\\n\\nDorian Gray shook his head. “I left her in the forest of Arden; I shall\\nfind her in an orchard in Verona.”\\n\\nLord Henry sipped his champagne in a meditative manner. “At what\\nparticular point did you mention the word marriage, Dorian? And what\\ndid she say in answer? Perhaps you forgot all about it.”\\n\\n“My dear Harry, I did not treat it as a business transaction, and I did\\nnot make any formal proposal. I told her that I loved her, and she said\\nshe was not worthy to be my wife. Not worthy! Why, the whole world is\\nnothing to me compared with her.”\\n\\n“Women are wonderfully practical,” murmured Lord Henry, “much more\\npractical than we are. In situations of that kind we often forget to\\nsay anything about marriage, and they always remind us.”\\n\\nHallward laid his hand upon his arm. “Don’t, Harry. You have annoyed\\nDorian. He is not like other men. He would never bring misery upon any\\none. His nature is too fine for that.”\\n\\nLord Henry looked across the table. “Dorian is never annoyed with me,”\\nhe answered. “I asked the question for the best reason possible, for\\nthe only reason, indeed, that excuses one for asking any\\nquestion—simple curiosity. I have a theory that it is always the women\\nwho propose to us, and not we who propose to the women. Except, of\\ncourse, in middle-class life. But then the middle classes are not\\nmodern.”\\n\\nDorian Gray laughed, and tossed his head. “You are quite incorrigible,\\nHarry; but I don’t mind. It is impossible to be angry with you. When\\nyou see Sibyl Vane, you will feel that the man who could wrong her\\nwould be a beast, a beast without a heart. I cannot understand how any\\none can wish to shame the thing he loves. I love Sibyl Vane. I want to\\nplace her on a pedestal of gold and to see the world worship the woman\\nwho is mine. What is marriage? An irrevocable vow. You mock at it for\\nthat. Ah! don’t mock. It is an irrevocable vow that I want to take. Her\\ntrust makes me faithful, her belief makes me good. When I am with her,\\nI regret all that you have taught me. I become different from what you\\nhave known me to be. I am changed, and the mere touch of Sibyl Vane’s\\nhand makes me forget you and all your wrong, fascinating, poisonous,\\ndelightful theories.”\\n\\n“And those are ...?” asked Lord Henry, helping himself to some salad.\\n\\n“Oh, your theories about life, your theories about love, your theories\\nabout pleasure. All your theories, in fact, Harry.”\\n\\n“Pleasure is the only thing worth having a theory about,” he answered\\nin his slow melodious voice. “But I am afraid I cannot claim my theory\\nas my own. It belongs to Nature, not to me. Pleasure is Nature’s test,\\nher sign of approval. When we are happy, we are always good, but when\\nwe are good, we are not always happy.”\\n\\n“Ah! but what do you mean by good?” cried Basil Hallward.\\n\\n“Yes,” echoed Dorian, leaning back in his chair and looking at Lord\\nHenry over the heavy clusters of purple-lipped irises that stood in the\\ncentre of the table, “what do you mean by good, Harry?”\\n\\n“To be good is to be in harmony with one’s self,” he replied, touching\\nthe thin stem of his glass with his pale, fine-pointed fingers.\\n“Discord is to be forced to be in harmony with others. One’s own\\nlife—that is the important thing. As for the lives of one’s neighbours,\\nif one wishes to be a prig or a Puritan, one can flaunt one’s moral\\nviews about them, but they are not one’s concern. Besides,\\nindividualism has really the higher aim. Modern morality consists in\\naccepting the standard of one’s age. I consider that for any man of\\nculture to accept the standard of his age is a form of the grossest\\nimmorality.”\\n\\n“But, surely, if one lives merely for one’s self, Harry, one pays a\\nterrible price for doing so?” suggested the painter.\\n\\n“Yes, we are overcharged for everything nowadays. I should fancy that\\nthe real tragedy of the poor is that they can afford nothing but\\nself-denial. Beautiful sins, like beautiful things, are the privilege\\nof the rich.”\\n\\n“One has to pay in other ways but money.”\\n\\n“What sort of ways, Basil?”\\n\\n“Oh! I should fancy in remorse, in suffering, in ... well, in the\\nconsciousness of degradation.”\\n\\nLord Henry shrugged his shoulders. “My dear fellow, mediæval art is\\ncharming, but mediæval emotions are out of date. One can use them in\\nfiction, of course. But then the only things that one can use in\\nfiction are the things that one has ceased to use in fact. Believe me,\\nno civilized man ever regrets a pleasure, and no uncivilized man ever\\nknows what a pleasure is.”\\n\\n“I know what pleasure is,” cried Dorian Gray. “It is to adore some\\none.”\\n\\n“That is certainly better than being adored,” he answered, toying with\\nsome fruits. “Being adored is a nuisance. Women treat us just as\\nhumanity treats its gods. They worship us, and are always bothering us\\nto do something for them.”\\n\\n“I should have said that whatever they ask for they had first given to\\nus,” murmured the lad gravely. “They create love in our natures. They\\nhave a right to demand it back.”\\n\\n“That is quite true, Dorian,” cried Hallward.\\n\\n“Nothing is ever quite true,” said Lord Henry.\\n\\n“This is,” interrupted Dorian. “You must admit, Harry, that women give\\nto men the very gold of their lives.”\\n\\n“Possibly,” he sighed, “but they invariably want it back in such very\\nsmall change. That is the worry. Women, as some witty Frenchman once\\nput it, inspire us with the desire to do masterpieces and always\\nprevent us from carrying them out.”\\n\\n“Harry, you are dreadful! I don’t know why I like you so much.”\\n\\n“You will always like me, Dorian,” he replied. “Will you have some\\ncoffee, you fellows? Waiter, bring coffee, and _fine-champagne_, and\\nsome cigarettes. No, don’t mind the cigarettes—I have some. Basil, I\\ncan’t allow you to smoke cigars. You must have a cigarette. A cigarette\\nis the perfect type of a perfect pleasure. It is exquisite, and it\\nleaves one unsatisfied. What more can one want? Yes, Dorian, you will\\nalways be fond of me. I represent to you all the sins you have never\\nhad the courage to commit.”\\n\\n“What nonsense you talk, Harry!” cried the lad, taking a light from a\\nfire-breathing silver dragon that the waiter had placed on the table.\\n“Let us go down to the theatre. When Sibyl comes on the stage you will\\nhave a new ideal of life. She will represent something to you that you\\nhave never known.”\\n\\n“I have known everything,” said Lord Henry, with a tired look in his\\neyes, “but I am always ready for a new emotion. I am afraid, however,\\nthat, for me at any rate, there is no such thing. Still, your wonderful\\ngirl may thrill me. I love acting. It is so much more real than life.\\nLet us go. Dorian, you will come with me. I am so sorry, Basil, but\\nthere is only room for two in the brougham. You must follow us in a\\nhansom.”\\n\\nThey got up and put on their coats, sipping their coffee standing. The\\npainter was silent and preoccupied. There was a gloom over him. He\\ncould not bear this marriage, and yet it seemed to him to be better\\nthan many other things that might have happened. After a few minutes,\\nthey all passed downstairs. He drove off by himself, as had been\\narranged, and watched the flashing lights of the little brougham in\\nfront of him. A strange sense of loss came over him. He felt that\\nDorian Gray would never again be to him all that he had been in the\\npast. Life had come between them.... His eyes darkened, and the crowded\\nflaring streets became blurred to his eyes. When the cab drew up at the\\ntheatre, it seemed to him that he had grown years older.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII.\\n\\n\\nFor some reason or other, the house was crowded that night, and the fat\\nJew manager who met them at the door was beaming from ear to ear with\\nan oily tremulous smile. He escorted them to their box with a sort of\\npompous humility, waving his fat jewelled hands and talking at the top\\nof his voice. Dorian Gray loathed him more than ever. He felt as if he\\nhad come to look for Miranda and had been met by Caliban. Lord Henry,\\nupon the other hand, rather liked him. At least he declared he did, and\\ninsisted on shaking him by the hand and assuring him that he was proud\\nto meet a man who had discovered a real genius and gone bankrupt over a\\npoet. Hallward amused himself with watching the faces in the pit. The\\nheat was terribly oppressive, and the huge sunlight flamed like a\\nmonstrous dahlia with petals of yellow fire. The youths in the gallery\\nhad taken off their coats and waistcoats and hung them over the side.\\nThey talked to each other across the theatre and shared their oranges\\nwith the tawdry girls who sat beside them. Some women were laughing in\\nthe pit. Their voices were horribly shrill and discordant. The sound of\\nthe popping of corks came from the bar.\\n\\n“What a place to find one’s divinity in!” said Lord Henry.\\n\\n“Yes!” answered Dorian Gray. “It was here I found her, and she is\\ndivine beyond all living things. When she acts, you will forget\\neverything. These common rough people, with their coarse faces and\\nbrutal gestures, become quite different when she is on the stage. They\\nsit silently and watch her. They weep and laugh as she wills them to\\ndo. She makes them as responsive as a violin. She spiritualizes them,\\nand one feels that they are of the same flesh and blood as one’s self.”\\n\\n“The same flesh and blood as one’s self! Oh, I hope not!” exclaimed\\nLord Henry, who was scanning the occupants of the gallery through his\\nopera-glass.\\n\\n“Don’t pay any attention to him, Dorian,” said the painter. “I\\nunderstand what you mean, and I believe in this girl. Any one you love\\nmust be marvellous, and any girl who has the effect you describe must\\nbe fine and noble. To spiritualize one’s age—that is something worth\\ndoing. If this girl can give a soul to those who have lived without\\none, if she can create the sense of beauty in people whose lives have\\nbeen sordid and ugly, if she can strip them of their selfishness and\\nlend them tears for sorrows that are not their own, she is worthy of\\nall your adoration, worthy of the adoration of the world. This marriage\\nis quite right. I did not think so at first, but I admit it now. The\\ngods made Sibyl Vane for you. Without her you would have been\\nincomplete.”\\n\\n“Thanks, Basil,” answered Dorian Gray, pressing his hand. “I knew that\\nyou would understand me. Harry is so cynical, he terrifies me. But here\\nis the orchestra. It is quite dreadful, but it only lasts for about\\nfive minutes. Then the curtain rises, and you will see the girl to whom\\nI am going to give all my life, to whom I have given everything that is\\ngood in me.”\\n\\nA quarter of an hour afterwards, amidst an extraordinary turmoil of\\napplause, Sibyl Vane stepped on to the stage. Yes, she was certainly\\nlovely to look at—one of the loveliest creatures, Lord Henry thought,\\nthat he had ever seen. There was something of the fawn in her shy grace\\nand startled eyes. A faint blush, like the shadow of a rose in a mirror\\nof silver, came to her cheeks as she glanced at the crowded\\nenthusiastic house. She stepped back a few paces and her lips seemed to\\ntremble. Basil Hallward leaped to his feet and began to applaud.\\nMotionless, and as one in a dream, sat Dorian Gray, gazing at her. Lord\\nHenry peered through his glasses, murmuring, “Charming! charming!”\\n\\nThe scene was the hall of Capulet’s house, and Romeo in his pilgrim’s\\ndress had entered with Mercutio and his other friends. The band, such\\nas it was, struck up a few bars of music, and the dance began. Through\\nthe crowd of ungainly, shabbily dressed actors, Sibyl Vane moved like a\\ncreature from a finer world. Her body swayed, while she danced, as a\\nplant sways in the water. The curves of her throat were the curves of a\\nwhite lily. Her hands seemed to be made of cool ivory.\\n\\nYet she was curiously listless. She showed no sign of joy when her eyes\\nrested on Romeo. The few words she had to speak—\\n\\nGood pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,\\n    Which mannerly devotion shows in this;\\nFor saints have hands that pilgrims’ hands do touch,\\n    And palm to palm is holy palmers’ kiss—\\n\\n\\nwith the brief dialogue that follows, were spoken in a thoroughly\\nartificial manner. The voice was exquisite, but from the point of view\\nof tone it was absolutely false. It was wrong in colour. It took away\\nall the life from the verse. It made the passion unreal.\\n\\nDorian Gray grew pale as he watched her. He was puzzled and anxious.\\nNeither of his friends dared to say anything to him. She seemed to them\\nto be absolutely incompetent. They were horribly disappointed.\\n\\nYet they felt that the true test of any Juliet is the balcony scene of\\nthe second act. They waited for that. If she failed there, there was\\nnothing in her.\\n\\nShe looked charming as she came out in the moonlight. That could not be\\ndenied. But the staginess of her acting was unbearable, and grew worse\\nas she went on. Her gestures became absurdly artificial. She\\noveremphasized everything that she had to say. The beautiful passage—\\n\\nThou knowest the mask of night is on my face,\\nElse would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek\\nFor that which thou hast heard me speak to-night—\\n\\n\\nwas declaimed with the painful precision of a schoolgirl who has been\\ntaught to recite by some second-rate professor of elocution. When she\\nleaned over the balcony and came to those wonderful lines—\\n\\nAlthough I joy in thee,\\nI have no joy of this contract to-night:\\nIt is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;\\nToo like the lightning, which doth cease to be\\nEre one can say, “It lightens.” Sweet, good-night!\\nThis bud of love by summer’s ripening breath\\nMay prove a beauteous flower when next we meet—\\n\\n\\nshe spoke the words as though they conveyed no meaning to her. It was\\nnot nervousness. Indeed, so far from being nervous, she was absolutely\\nself-contained. It was simply bad art. She was a complete failure.\\n\\nEven the common uneducated audience of the pit and gallery lost their\\ninterest in the play. They got restless, and began to talk loudly and\\nto whistle. The Jew manager, who was standing at the back of the\\ndress-circle, stamped and swore with rage. The only person unmoved was\\nthe girl herself.\\n\\nWhen the second act was over, there came a storm of hisses, and Lord\\nHenry got up from his chair and put on his coat. “She is quite\\nbeautiful, Dorian,” he said, “but she can’t act. Let us go.”\\n\\n“I am going to see the play through,” answered the lad, in a hard\\nbitter voice. “I am awfully sorry that I have made you waste an\\nevening, Harry. I apologize to you both.”\\n\\n“My dear Dorian, I should think Miss Vane was ill,” interrupted\\nHallward. “We will come some other night.”\\n\\n“I wish she were ill,” he rejoined. “But she seems to me to be simply\\ncallous and cold. She has entirely altered. Last night she was a great\\nartist. This evening she is merely a commonplace mediocre actress.”\\n\\n“Don’t talk like that about any one you love, Dorian. Love is a more\\nwonderful thing than art.”\\n\\n“They are both simply forms of imitation,” remarked Lord Henry. “But do\\nlet us go. Dorian, you must not stay here any longer. It is not good\\nfor one’s morals to see bad acting. Besides, I don’t suppose you will\\nwant your wife to act, so what does it matter if she plays Juliet like\\na wooden doll? She is very lovely, and if she knows as little about\\nlife as she does about acting, she will be a delightful experience.\\nThere are only two kinds of people who are really fascinating—people\\nwho know absolutely everything, and people who know absolutely nothing.\\nGood heavens, my dear boy, don’t look so tragic! The secret of\\nremaining young is never to have an emotion that is unbecoming. Come to\\nthe club with Basil and myself. We will smoke cigarettes and drink to\\nthe beauty of Sibyl Vane. She is beautiful. What more can you want?”\\n\\n“Go away, Harry,” cried the lad. “I want to be alone. Basil, you must\\ngo. Ah! can’t you see that my heart is breaking?” The hot tears came to\\nhis eyes. His lips trembled, and rushing to the back of the box, he\\nleaned up against the wall, hiding his face in his hands.\\n\\n“Let us go, Basil,” said Lord Henry with a strange tenderness in his\\nvoice, and the two young men passed out together.\\n\\nA few moments afterwards the footlights flared up and the curtain rose\\non the third act. Dorian Gray went back to his seat. He looked pale,\\nand proud, and indifferent. The play dragged on, and seemed\\ninterminable. Half of the audience went out, tramping in heavy boots\\nand laughing. The whole thing was a _fiasco_. The last act was played\\nto almost empty benches. The curtain went down on a titter and some\\ngroans.\\n\\nAs soon as it was over, Dorian Gray rushed behind the scenes into the\\ngreenroom. The girl was standing there alone, with a look of triumph on\\nher face. Her eyes were lit with an exquisite fire. There was a\\nradiance about her. Her parted lips were smiling over some secret of\\ntheir own.\\n\\nWhen he entered, she looked at him, and an expression of infinite joy\\ncame over her. “How badly I acted to-night, Dorian!” she cried.\\n\\n“Horribly!” he answered, gazing at her in amazement. “Horribly! It was\\ndreadful. Are you ill? You have no idea what it was. You have no idea\\nwhat I suffered.”\\n\\nThe girl smiled. “Dorian,” she answered, lingering over his name with\\nlong-drawn music in her voice, as though it were sweeter than honey to\\nthe red petals of her mouth. “Dorian, you should have understood. But\\nyou understand now, don’t you?”\\n\\n“Understand what?” he asked, angrily.\\n\\n“Why I was so bad to-night. Why I shall always be bad. Why I shall\\nnever act well again.”\\n\\nHe shrugged his shoulders. “You are ill, I suppose. When you are ill\\nyou shouldn’t act. You make yourself ridiculous. My friends were bored.\\nI was bored.”\\n\\nShe seemed not to listen to him. She was transfigured with joy. An\\necstasy of happiness dominated her.\\n\\n“Dorian, Dorian,” she cried, “before I knew you, acting was the one\\nreality of my life. It was only in the theatre that I lived. I thought\\nthat it was all true. I was Rosalind one night and Portia the other.\\nThe joy of Beatrice was my joy, and the sorrows of Cordelia were mine\\nalso. I believed in everything. The common people who acted with me\\nseemed to me to be godlike. The painted scenes were my world. I knew\\nnothing but shadows, and I thought them real. You came—oh, my beautiful\\nlove!—and you freed my soul from prison. You taught me what reality\\nreally is. To-night, for the first time in my life, I saw through the\\nhollowness, the sham, the silliness of the empty pageant in which I had\\nalways played. To-night, for the first time, I became conscious that\\nthe Romeo was hideous, and old, and painted, that the moonlight in the\\norchard was false, that the scenery was vulgar, and that the words I\\nhad to speak were unreal, were not my words, were not what I wanted to\\nsay. You had brought me something higher, something of which all art is\\nbut a reflection. You had made me understand what love really is. My\\nlove! My love! Prince Charming! Prince of life! I have grown sick of\\nshadows. You are more to me than all art can ever be. What have I to do\\nwith the puppets of a play? When I came on to-night, I could not\\nunderstand how it was that everything had gone from me. I thought that\\nI was going to be wonderful. I found that I could do nothing. Suddenly\\nit dawned on my soul what it all meant. The knowledge was exquisite to\\nme. I heard them hissing, and I smiled. What could they know of love\\nsuch as ours? Take me away, Dorian—take me away with you, where we can\\nbe quite alone. I hate the stage. I might mimic a passion that I do not\\nfeel, but I cannot mimic one that burns me like fire. Oh, Dorian,\\nDorian, you understand now what it signifies? Even if I could do it, it\\nwould be profanation for me to play at being in love. You have made me\\nsee that.”\\n\\nHe flung himself down on the sofa and turned away his face. “You have\\nkilled my love,” he muttered.\\n\\nShe looked at him in wonder and laughed. He made no answer. She came\\nacross to him, and with her little fingers stroked his hair. She knelt\\ndown and pressed his hands to her lips. He drew them away, and a\\nshudder ran through him.\\n\\nThen he leaped up and went to the door. “Yes,” he cried, “you have\\nkilled my love. You used to stir my imagination. Now you don’t even\\nstir my curiosity. You simply produce no effect. I loved you because\\nyou were marvellous, because you had genius and intellect, because you\\nrealized the dreams of great poets and gave shape and substance to the\\nshadows of art. You have thrown it all away. You are shallow and\\nstupid. My God! how mad I was to love you! What a fool I have been! You\\nare nothing to me now. I will never see you again. I will never think\\nof you. I will never mention your name. You don’t know what you were to\\nme, once. Why, once ... Oh, I can’t bear to think of it! I wish I had\\nnever laid eyes upon you! You have spoiled the romance of my life. How\\nlittle you can know of love, if you say it mars your art! Without your\\nart, you are nothing. I would have made you famous, splendid,\\nmagnificent. The world would have worshipped you, and you would have\\nborne my name. What are you now? A third-rate actress with a pretty\\nface.”\\n\\nThe girl grew white, and trembled. She clenched her hands together, and\\nher voice seemed to catch in her throat. “You are not serious, Dorian?”\\nshe murmured. “You are acting.”\\n\\n“Acting! I leave that to you. You do it so well,” he answered bitterly.\\n\\nShe rose from her knees and, with a piteous expression of pain in her\\nface, came across the room to him. She put her hand upon his arm and\\nlooked into his eyes. He thrust her back. “Don’t touch me!” he cried.\\n\\nA low moan broke from her, and she flung herself at his feet and lay\\nthere like a trampled flower. “Dorian, Dorian, don’t leave me!” she\\nwhispered. “I am so sorry I didn’t act well. I was thinking of you all\\nthe time. But I will try—indeed, I will try. It came so suddenly across\\nme, my love for you. I think I should never have known it if you had\\nnot kissed me—if we had not kissed each other. Kiss me again, my love.\\nDon’t go away from me. I couldn’t bear it. Oh! don’t go away from me.\\nMy brother ... No; never mind. He didn’t mean it. He was in jest....\\nBut you, oh! can’t you forgive me for to-night? I will work so hard and\\ntry to improve. Don’t be cruel to me, because I love you better than\\nanything in the world. After all, it is only once that I have not\\npleased you. But you are quite right, Dorian. I should have shown\\nmyself more of an artist. It was foolish of me, and yet I couldn’t help\\nit. Oh, don’t leave me, don’t leave me.” A fit of passionate sobbing\\nchoked her. She crouched on the floor like a wounded thing, and Dorian\\nGray, with his beautiful eyes, looked down at her, and his chiselled\\nlips curled in exquisite disdain. There is always something ridiculous\\nabout the emotions of people whom one has ceased to love. Sibyl Vane\\nseemed to him to be absurdly melodramatic. Her tears and sobs annoyed\\nhim.\\n\\n“I am going,” he said at last in his calm clear voice. “I don’t wish to\\nbe unkind, but I can’t see you again. You have disappointed me.”\\n\\nShe wept silently, and made no answer, but crept nearer. Her little\\nhands stretched blindly out, and appeared to be seeking for him. He\\nturned on his heel and left the room. In a few moments he was out of\\nthe theatre.\\n\\nWhere he went to he hardly knew. He remembered wandering through dimly\\nlit streets, past gaunt, black-shadowed archways and evil-looking\\nhouses. Women with hoarse voices and harsh laughter had called after\\nhim. Drunkards had reeled by, cursing and chattering to themselves like\\nmonstrous apes. He had seen grotesque children huddled upon door-steps,\\nand heard shrieks and oaths from gloomy courts.\\n\\nAs the dawn was just breaking, he found himself close to Covent Garden.\\nThe darkness lifted, and, flushed with faint fires, the sky hollowed\\nitself into a perfect pearl. Huge carts filled with nodding lilies\\nrumbled slowly down the polished empty street. The air was heavy with\\nthe perfume of the flowers, and their beauty seemed to bring him an\\nanodyne for his pain. He followed into the market and watched the men\\nunloading their waggons. A white-smocked carter offered him some\\ncherries. He thanked him, wondered why he refused to accept any money\\nfor them, and began to eat them listlessly. They had been plucked at\\nmidnight, and the coldness of the moon had entered into them. A long\\nline of boys carrying crates of striped tulips, and of yellow and red\\nroses, defiled in front of him, threading their way through the huge,\\njade-green piles of vegetables. Under the portico, with its grey,\\nsun-bleached pillars, loitered a troop of draggled bareheaded girls,\\nwaiting for the auction to be over. Others crowded round the swinging\\ndoors of the coffee-house in the piazza. The heavy cart-horses slipped\\nand stamped upon the rough stones, shaking their bells and trappings.\\nSome of the drivers were lying asleep on a pile of sacks. Iris-necked\\nand pink-footed, the pigeons ran about picking up seeds.\\n\\nAfter a little while, he hailed a hansom and drove home. For a few\\nmoments he loitered upon the doorstep, looking round at the silent\\nsquare, with its blank, close-shuttered windows and its staring blinds.\\nThe sky was pure opal now, and the roofs of the houses glistened like\\nsilver against it. From some chimney opposite a thin wreath of smoke\\nwas rising. It curled, a violet riband, through the nacre-coloured air.\\n\\nIn the huge gilt Venetian lantern, spoil of some Doge’s barge, that\\nhung from the ceiling of the great, oak-panelled hall of entrance,\\nlights were still burning from three flickering jets: thin blue petals\\nof flame they seemed, rimmed with white fire. He turned them out and,\\nhaving thrown his hat and cape on the table, passed through the library\\ntowards the door of his bedroom, a large octagonal chamber on the\\nground floor that, in his new-born feeling for luxury, he had just had\\ndecorated for himself and hung with some curious Renaissance tapestries\\nthat had been discovered stored in a disused attic at Selby Royal. As\\nhe was turning the handle of the door, his eye fell upon the portrait\\nBasil Hallward had painted of him. He started back as if in surprise.\\nThen he went on into his own room, looking somewhat puzzled. After he\\nhad taken the button-hole out of his coat, he seemed to hesitate.\\nFinally, he came back, went over to the picture, and examined it. In\\nthe dim arrested light that struggled through the cream-coloured silk\\nblinds, the face appeared to him to be a little changed. The expression\\nlooked different. One would have said that there was a touch of cruelty\\nin the mouth. It was certainly strange.\\n\\nHe turned round and, walking to the window, drew up the blind. The\\nbright dawn flooded the room and swept the fantastic shadows into dusky\\ncorners, where they lay shuddering. But the strange expression that he\\nhad noticed in the face of the portrait seemed to linger there, to be\\nmore intensified even. The quivering ardent sunlight showed him the\\nlines of cruelty round the mouth as clearly as if he had been looking\\ninto a mirror after he had done some dreadful thing.\\n\\nHe winced and, taking up from the table an oval glass framed in ivory\\nCupids, one of Lord Henry’s many presents to him, glanced hurriedly\\ninto its polished depths. No line like that warped his red lips. What\\ndid it mean?\\n\\nHe rubbed his eyes, and came close to the picture, and examined it\\nagain. There were no signs of any change when he looked into the actual\\npainting, and yet there was no doubt that the whole expression had\\naltered. It was not a mere fancy of his own. The thing was horribly\\napparent.\\n\\nHe threw himself into a chair and began to think. Suddenly there\\nflashed across his mind what he had said in Basil Hallward’s studio the\\nday the picture had been finished. Yes, he remembered it perfectly. He\\nhad uttered a mad wish that he himself might remain young, and the\\nportrait grow old; that his own beauty might be untarnished, and the\\nface on the canvas bear the burden of his passions and his sins; that\\nthe painted image might be seared with the lines of suffering and\\nthought, and that he might keep all the delicate bloom and loveliness\\nof his then just conscious boyhood. Surely his wish had not been\\nfulfilled? Such things were impossible. It seemed monstrous even to\\nthink of them. And, yet, there was the picture before him, with the\\ntouch of cruelty in the mouth.\\n\\nCruelty! Had he been cruel? It was the girl’s fault, not his. He had\\ndreamed of her as a great artist, had given his love to her because he\\nhad thought her great. Then she had disappointed him. She had been\\nshallow and unworthy. And, yet, a feeling of infinite regret came over\\nhim, as he thought of her lying at his feet sobbing like a little\\nchild. He remembered with what callousness he had watched her. Why had\\nhe been made like that? Why had such a soul been given to him? But he\\nhad suffered also. During the three terrible hours that the play had\\nlasted, he had lived centuries of pain, aeon upon aeon of torture. His\\nlife was well worth hers. She had marred him for a moment, if he had\\nwounded her for an age. Besides, women were better suited to bear\\nsorrow than men. They lived on their emotions. They only thought of\\ntheir emotions. When they took lovers, it was merely to have some one\\nwith whom they could have scenes. Lord Henry had told him that, and\\nLord Henry knew what women were. Why should he trouble about Sibyl\\nVane? She was nothing to him now.\\n\\nBut the picture? What was he to say of that? It held the secret of his\\nlife, and told his story. It had taught him to love his own beauty.\\nWould it teach him to loathe his own soul? Would he ever look at it\\nagain?\\n\\nNo; it was merely an illusion wrought on the troubled senses. The\\nhorrible night that he had passed had left phantoms behind it. Suddenly\\nthere had fallen upon his brain that tiny scarlet speck that makes men\\nmad. The picture had not changed. It was folly to think so.\\n\\nYet it was watching him, with its beautiful marred face and its cruel\\nsmile. Its bright hair gleamed in the early sunlight. Its blue eyes met\\nhis own. A sense of infinite pity, not for himself, but for the painted\\nimage of himself, came over him. It had altered already, and would\\nalter more. Its gold would wither into grey. Its red and white roses\\nwould die. For every sin that he committed, a stain would fleck and\\nwreck its fairness. But he would not sin. The picture, changed or\\nunchanged, would be to him the visible emblem of conscience. He would\\nresist temptation. He would not see Lord Henry any more—would not, at\\nany rate, listen to those subtle poisonous theories that in Basil\\nHallward’s garden had first stirred within him the passion for\\nimpossible things. He would go back to Sibyl Vane, make her amends,\\nmarry her, try to love her again. Yes, it was his duty to do so. She\\nmust have suffered more than he had. Poor child! He had been selfish\\nand cruel to her. The fascination that she had exercised over him would\\nreturn. They would be happy together. His life with her would be\\nbeautiful and pure.\\n\\nHe got up from his chair and drew a large screen right in front of the\\nportrait, shuddering as he glanced at it. “How horrible!” he murmured\\nto himself, and he walked across to the window and opened it. When he\\nstepped out on to the grass, he drew a deep breath. The fresh morning\\nair seemed to drive away all his sombre passions. He thought only of\\nSibyl. A faint echo of his love came back to him. He repeated her name\\nover and over again. The birds that were singing in the dew-drenched\\ngarden seemed to be telling the flowers about her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII.\\n\\n\\nIt was long past noon when he awoke. His valet had crept several times\\non tiptoe into the room to see if he was stirring, and had wondered\\nwhat made his young master sleep so late. Finally his bell sounded, and\\nVictor came in softly with a cup of tea, and a pile of letters, on a\\nsmall tray of old Sevres china, and drew back the olive-satin curtains,\\nwith their shimmering blue lining, that hung in front of the three tall\\nwindows.\\n\\n“Monsieur has well slept this morning,” he said, smiling.\\n\\n“What o’clock is it, Victor?” asked Dorian Gray drowsily.\\n\\n“One hour and a quarter, Monsieur.”\\n\\nHow late it was! He sat up, and having sipped some tea, turned over his\\nletters. One of them was from Lord Henry, and had been brought by hand\\nthat morning. He hesitated for a moment, and then put it aside. The\\nothers he opened listlessly. They contained the usual collection of\\ncards, invitations to dinner, tickets for private views, programmes of\\ncharity concerts, and the like that are showered on fashionable young\\nmen every morning during the season. There was a rather heavy bill for\\na chased silver Louis-Quinze toilet-set that he had not yet had the\\ncourage to send on to his guardians, who were extremely old-fashioned\\npeople and did not realize that we live in an age when unnecessary\\nthings are our only necessities; and there were several very\\ncourteously worded communications from Jermyn Street money-lenders\\noffering to advance any sum of money at a moment’s notice and at the\\nmost reasonable rates of interest.\\n\\nAfter about ten minutes he got up, and throwing on an elaborate\\ndressing-gown of silk-embroidered cashmere wool, passed into the\\nonyx-paved bathroom. The cool water refreshed him after his long sleep.\\nHe seemed to have forgotten all that he had gone through. A dim sense\\nof having taken part in some strange tragedy came to him once or twice,\\nbut there was the unreality of a dream about it.\\n\\nAs soon as he was dressed, he went into the library and sat down to a\\nlight French breakfast that had been laid out for him on a small round\\ntable close to the open window. It was an exquisite day. The warm air\\nseemed laden with spices. A bee flew in and buzzed round the\\nblue-dragon bowl that, filled with sulphur-yellow roses, stood before\\nhim. He felt perfectly happy.\\n\\nSuddenly his eye fell on the screen that he had placed in front of the\\nportrait, and he started.\\n\\n“Too cold for Monsieur?” asked his valet, putting an omelette on the\\ntable. “I shut the window?”\\n\\nDorian shook his head. “I am not cold,” he murmured.\\n\\nWas it all true? Had the portrait really changed? Or had it been simply\\nhis own imagination that had made him see a look of evil where there\\nhad been a look of joy? Surely a painted canvas could not alter? The\\nthing was absurd. It would serve as a tale to tell Basil some day. It\\nwould make him smile.\\n\\nAnd, yet, how vivid was his recollection of the whole thing! First in\\nthe dim twilight, and then in the bright dawn, he had seen the touch of\\ncruelty round the warped lips. He almost dreaded his valet leaving the\\nroom. He knew that when he was alone he would have to examine the\\nportrait. He was afraid of certainty. When the coffee and cigarettes\\nhad been brought and the man turned to go, he felt a wild desire to\\ntell him to remain. As the door was closing behind him, he called him\\nback. The man stood waiting for his orders. Dorian looked at him for a\\nmoment. “I am not at home to any one, Victor,” he said with a sigh. The\\nman bowed and retired.\\n\\nThen he rose from the table, lit a cigarette, and flung himself down on\\na luxuriously cushioned couch that stood facing the screen. The screen\\nwas an old one, of gilt Spanish leather, stamped and wrought with a\\nrather florid Louis-Quatorze pattern. He scanned it curiously,\\nwondering if ever before it had concealed the secret of a man’s life.\\n\\nShould he move it aside, after all? Why not let it stay there? What was\\nthe use of knowing? If the thing was true, it was terrible. If it was\\nnot true, why trouble about it? But what if, by some fate or deadlier\\nchance, eyes other than his spied behind and saw the horrible change?\\nWhat should he do if Basil Hallward came and asked to look at his own\\npicture? Basil would be sure to do that. No; the thing had to be\\nexamined, and at once. Anything would be better than this dreadful\\nstate of doubt.\\n\\nHe got up and locked both doors. At least he would be alone when he\\nlooked upon the mask of his shame. Then he drew the screen aside and\\nsaw himself face to face. It was perfectly true. The portrait had\\naltered.\\n\\nAs he often remembered afterwards, and always with no small wonder, he\\nfound himself at first gazing at the portrait with a feeling of almost\\nscientific interest. That such a change should have taken place was\\nincredible to him. And yet it was a fact. Was there some subtle\\naffinity between the chemical atoms that shaped themselves into form\\nand colour on the canvas and the soul that was within him? Could it be\\nthat what that soul thought, they realized?—that what it dreamed, they\\nmade true? Or was there some other, more terrible reason? He shuddered,\\nand felt afraid, and, going back to the couch, lay there, gazing at the\\npicture in sickened horror.\\n\\nOne thing, however, he felt that it had done for him. It had made him\\nconscious how unjust, how cruel, he had been to Sibyl Vane. It was not\\ntoo late to make reparation for that. She could still be his wife. His\\nunreal and selfish love would yield to some higher influence, would be\\ntransformed into some nobler passion, and the portrait that Basil\\nHallward had painted of him would be a guide to him through life, would\\nbe to him what holiness is to some, and conscience to others, and the\\nfear of God to us all. There were opiates for remorse, drugs that could\\nlull the moral sense to sleep. But here was a visible symbol of the\\ndegradation of sin. Here was an ever-present sign of the ruin men\\nbrought upon their souls.\\n\\nThree o’clock struck, and four, and the half-hour rang its double\\nchime, but Dorian Gray did not stir. He was trying to gather up the\\nscarlet threads of life and to weave them into a pattern; to find his\\nway through the sanguine labyrinth of passion through which he was\\nwandering. He did not know what to do, or what to think. Finally, he\\nwent over to the table and wrote a passionate letter to the girl he had\\nloved, imploring her forgiveness and accusing himself of madness. He\\ncovered page after page with wild words of sorrow and wilder words of\\npain. There is a luxury in self-reproach. When we blame ourselves, we\\nfeel that no one else has a right to blame us. It is the confession,\\nnot the priest, that gives us absolution. When Dorian had finished the\\nletter, he felt that he had been forgiven.\\n\\nSuddenly there came a knock to the door, and he heard Lord Henry’s\\nvoice outside. “My dear boy, I must see you. Let me in at once. I can’t\\nbear your shutting yourself up like this.”\\n\\nHe made no answer at first, but remained quite still. The knocking\\nstill continued and grew louder. Yes, it was better to let Lord Henry\\nin, and to explain to him the new life he was going to lead, to quarrel\\nwith him if it became necessary to quarrel, to part if parting was\\ninevitable. He jumped up, drew the screen hastily across the picture,\\nand unlocked the door.\\n\\n“I am so sorry for it all, Dorian,” said Lord Henry as he entered. “But\\nyou must not think too much about it.”\\n\\n“Do you mean about Sibyl Vane?” asked the lad.\\n\\n“Yes, of course,” answered Lord Henry, sinking into a chair and slowly\\npulling off his yellow gloves. “It is dreadful, from one point of view,\\nbut it was not your fault. Tell me, did you go behind and see her,\\nafter the play was over?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“I felt sure you had. Did you make a scene with her?”\\n\\n“I was brutal, Harry—perfectly brutal. But it is all right now. I am\\nnot sorry for anything that has happened. It has taught me to know\\nmyself better.”\\n\\n“Ah, Dorian, I am so glad you take it in that way! I was afraid I would\\nfind you plunged in remorse and tearing that nice curly hair of yours.”\\n\\n“I have got through all that,” said Dorian, shaking his head and\\nsmiling. “I am perfectly happy now. I know what conscience is, to begin\\nwith. It is not what you told me it was. It is the divinest thing in\\nus. Don’t sneer at it, Harry, any more—at least not before me. I want\\nto be good. I can’t bear the idea of my soul being hideous.”\\n\\n“A very charming artistic basis for ethics, Dorian! I congratulate you\\non it. But how are you going to begin?”\\n\\n“By marrying Sibyl Vane.”\\n\\n“Marrying Sibyl Vane!” cried Lord Henry, standing up and looking at him\\nin perplexed amazement. “But, my dear Dorian—”\\n\\n“Yes, Harry, I know what you are going to say. Something dreadful about\\nmarriage. Don’t say it. Don’t ever say things of that kind to me again.\\nTwo days ago I asked Sibyl to marry me. I am not going to break my word\\nto her. She is to be my wife.”\\n\\n“Your wife! Dorian! ... Didn’t you get my letter? I wrote to you this\\nmorning, and sent the note down by my own man.”\\n\\n“Your letter? Oh, yes, I remember. I have not read it yet, Harry. I was\\nafraid there might be something in it that I wouldn’t like. You cut\\nlife to pieces with your epigrams.”\\n\\n“You know nothing then?”\\n\\n“What do you mean?”\\n\\nLord Henry walked across the room, and sitting down by Dorian Gray,\\ntook both his hands in his own and held them tightly. “Dorian,” he\\nsaid, “my letter—don’t be frightened—was to tell you that Sibyl Vane is\\ndead.”\\n\\nA cry of pain broke from the lad’s lips, and he leaped to his feet,\\ntearing his hands away from Lord Henry’s grasp. “Dead! Sibyl dead! It\\nis not true! It is a horrible lie! How dare you say it?”\\n\\n“It is quite true, Dorian,” said Lord Henry, gravely. “It is in all the\\nmorning papers. I wrote down to you to ask you not to see any one till\\nI came. There will have to be an inquest, of course, and you must not\\nbe mixed up in it. Things like that make a man fashionable in Paris.\\nBut in London people are so prejudiced. Here, one should never make\\none’s _début_ with a scandal. One should reserve that to give an\\ninterest to one’s old age. I suppose they don’t know your name at the\\ntheatre? If they don’t, it is all right. Did any one see you going\\nround to her room? That is an important point.”\\n\\nDorian did not answer for a few moments. He was dazed with horror.\\nFinally he stammered, in a stifled voice, “Harry, did you say an\\ninquest? What did you mean by that? Did Sibyl—? Oh, Harry, I can’t bear\\nit! But be quick. Tell me everything at once.”\\n\\n“I have no doubt it was not an accident, Dorian, though it must be put\\nin that way to the public. It seems that as she was leaving the theatre\\nwith her mother, about half-past twelve or so, she said she had\\nforgotten something upstairs. They waited some time for her, but she\\ndid not come down again. They ultimately found her lying dead on the\\nfloor of her dressing-room. She had swallowed something by mistake,\\nsome dreadful thing they use at theatres. I don’t know what it was, but\\nit had either prussic acid or white lead in it. I should fancy it was\\nprussic acid, as she seems to have died instantaneously.”\\n\\n“Harry, Harry, it is terrible!” cried the lad.\\n\\n“Yes; it is very tragic, of course, but you must not get yourself mixed\\nup in it. I see by _The Standard_ that she was seventeen. I should have\\nthought she was almost younger than that. She looked such a child, and\\nseemed to know so little about acting. Dorian, you mustn’t let this\\nthing get on your nerves. You must come and dine with me, and\\nafterwards we will look in at the opera. It is a Patti night, and\\neverybody will be there. You can come to my sister’s box. She has got\\nsome smart women with her.”\\n\\n“So I have murdered Sibyl Vane,” said Dorian Gray, half to himself,\\n“murdered her as surely as if I had cut her little throat with a knife.\\nYet the roses are not less lovely for all that. The birds sing just as\\nhappily in my garden. And to-night I am to dine with you, and then go\\non to the opera, and sup somewhere, I suppose, afterwards. How\\nextraordinarily dramatic life is! If I had read all this in a book,\\nHarry, I think I would have wept over it. Somehow, now that it has\\nhappened actually, and to me, it seems far too wonderful for tears.\\nHere is the first passionate love-letter I have ever written in my\\nlife. Strange, that my first passionate love-letter should have been\\naddressed to a dead girl. Can they feel, I wonder, those white silent\\npeople we call the dead? Sibyl! Can she feel, or know, or listen? Oh,\\nHarry, how I loved her once! It seems years ago to me now. She was\\neverything to me. Then came that dreadful night—was it really only last\\nnight?—when she played so badly, and my heart almost broke. She\\nexplained it all to me. It was terribly pathetic. But I was not moved a\\nbit. I thought her shallow. Suddenly something happened that made me\\nafraid. I can’t tell you what it was, but it was terrible. I said I\\nwould go back to her. I felt I had done wrong. And now she is dead. My\\nGod! My God! Harry, what shall I do? You don’t know the danger I am in,\\nand there is nothing to keep me straight. She would have done that for\\nme. She had no right to kill herself. It was selfish of her.”\\n\\n“My dear Dorian,” answered Lord Henry, taking a cigarette from his case\\nand producing a gold-latten matchbox, “the only way a woman can ever\\nreform a man is by boring him so completely that he loses all possible\\ninterest in life. If you had married this girl, you would have been\\nwretched. Of course, you would have treated her kindly. One can always\\nbe kind to people about whom one cares nothing. But she would have soon\\nfound out that you were absolutely indifferent to her. And when a woman\\nfinds that out about her husband, she either becomes dreadfully dowdy,\\nor wears very smart bonnets that some other woman’s husband has to pay\\nfor. I say nothing about the social mistake, which would have been\\nabject—which, of course, I would not have allowed—but I assure you that\\nin any case the whole thing would have been an absolute failure.”\\n\\n“I suppose it would,” muttered the lad, walking up and down the room\\nand looking horribly pale. “But I thought it was my duty. It is not my\\nfault that this terrible tragedy has prevented my doing what was right.\\nI remember your saying once that there is a fatality about good\\nresolutions—that they are always made too late. Mine certainly were.”\\n\\n“Good resolutions are useless attempts to interfere with scientific\\nlaws. Their origin is pure vanity. Their result is absolutely _nil_.\\nThey give us, now and then, some of those luxurious sterile emotions\\nthat have a certain charm for the weak. That is all that can be said\\nfor them. They are simply cheques that men draw on a bank where they\\nhave no account.”\\n\\n“Harry,” cried Dorian Gray, coming over and sitting down beside him,\\n“why is it that I cannot feel this tragedy as much as I want to? I\\ndon’t think I am heartless. Do you?”\\n\\n“You have done too many foolish things during the last fortnight to be\\nentitled to give yourself that name, Dorian,” answered Lord Henry with\\nhis sweet melancholy smile.\\n\\nThe lad frowned. “I don’t like that explanation, Harry,” he rejoined,\\n“but I am glad you don’t think I am heartless. I am nothing of the\\nkind. I know I am not. And yet I must admit that this thing that has\\nhappened does not affect me as it should. It seems to me to be simply\\nlike a wonderful ending to a wonderful play. It has all the terrible\\nbeauty of a Greek tragedy, a tragedy in which I took a great part, but\\nby which I have not been wounded.”\\n\\n“It is an interesting question,” said Lord Henry, who found an\\nexquisite pleasure in playing on the lad’s unconscious egotism, “an\\nextremely interesting question. I fancy that the true explanation is\\nthis: It often happens that the real tragedies of life occur in such an\\ninartistic manner that they hurt us by their crude violence, their\\nabsolute incoherence, their absurd want of meaning, their entire lack\\nof style. They affect us just as vulgarity affects us. They give us an\\nimpression of sheer brute force, and we revolt against that. Sometimes,\\nhowever, a tragedy that possesses artistic elements of beauty crosses\\nour lives. If these elements of beauty are real, the whole thing simply\\nappeals to our sense of dramatic effect. Suddenly we find that we are\\nno longer the actors, but the spectators of the play. Or rather we are\\nboth. We watch ourselves, and the mere wonder of the spectacle\\nenthralls us. In the present case, what is it that has really happened?\\nSome one has killed herself for love of you. I wish that I had ever had\\nsuch an experience. It would have made me in love with love for the\\nrest of my life. The people who have adored me—there have not been very\\nmany, but there have been some—have always insisted on living on, long\\nafter I had ceased to care for them, or they to care for me. They have\\nbecome stout and tedious, and when I meet them, they go in at once for\\nreminiscences. That awful memory of woman! What a fearful thing it is!\\nAnd what an utter intellectual stagnation it reveals! One should absorb\\nthe colour of life, but one should never remember its details. Details\\nare always vulgar.”\\n\\n“I must sow poppies in my garden,” sighed Dorian.\\n\\n“There is no necessity,” rejoined his companion. “Life has always\\npoppies in her hands. Of course, now and then things linger. I once\\nwore nothing but violets all through one season, as a form of artistic\\nmourning for a romance that would not die. Ultimately, however, it did\\ndie. I forget what killed it. I think it was her proposing to sacrifice\\nthe whole world for me. That is always a dreadful moment. It fills one\\nwith the terror of eternity. Well—would you believe it?—a week ago, at\\nLady Hampshire’s, I found myself seated at dinner next the lady in\\nquestion, and she insisted on going over the whole thing again, and\\ndigging up the past, and raking up the future. I had buried my romance\\nin a bed of asphodel. She dragged it out again and assured me that I\\nhad spoiled her life. I am bound to state that she ate an enormous\\ndinner, so I did not feel any anxiety. But what a lack of taste she\\nshowed! The one charm of the past is that it is the past. But women\\nnever know when the curtain has fallen. They always want a sixth act,\\nand as soon as the interest of the play is entirely over, they propose\\nto continue it. If they were allowed their own way, every comedy would\\nhave a tragic ending, and every tragedy would culminate in a farce.\\nThey are charmingly artificial, but they have no sense of art. You are\\nmore fortunate than I am. I assure you, Dorian, that not one of the\\nwomen I have known would have done for me what Sibyl Vane did for you.\\nOrdinary women always console themselves. Some of them do it by going\\nin for sentimental colours. Never trust a woman who wears mauve,\\nwhatever her age may be, or a woman over thirty-five who is fond of\\npink ribbons. It always means that they have a history. Others find a\\ngreat consolation in suddenly discovering the good qualities of their\\nhusbands. They flaunt their conjugal felicity in one’s face, as if it\\nwere the most fascinating of sins. Religion consoles some. Its\\nmysteries have all the charm of a flirtation, a woman once told me, and\\nI can quite understand it. Besides, nothing makes one so vain as being\\ntold that one is a sinner. Conscience makes egotists of us all. Yes;\\nthere is really no end to the consolations that women find in modern\\nlife. Indeed, I have not mentioned the most important one.”\\n\\n“What is that, Harry?” said the lad listlessly.\\n\\n“Oh, the obvious consolation. Taking some one else’s admirer when one\\nloses one’s own. In good society that always whitewashes a woman. But\\nreally, Dorian, how different Sibyl Vane must have been from all the\\nwomen one meets! There is something to me quite beautiful about her\\ndeath. I am glad I am living in a century when such wonders happen.\\nThey make one believe in the reality of the things we all play with,\\nsuch as romance, passion, and love.”\\n\\n“I was terribly cruel to her. You forget that.”\\n\\n“I am afraid that women appreciate cruelty, downright cruelty, more\\nthan anything else. They have wonderfully primitive instincts. We have\\nemancipated them, but they remain slaves looking for their masters, all\\nthe same. They love being dominated. I am sure you were splendid. I\\nhave never seen you really and absolutely angry, but I can fancy how\\ndelightful you looked. And, after all, you said something to me the day\\nbefore yesterday that seemed to me at the time to be merely fanciful,\\nbut that I see now was absolutely true, and it holds the key to\\neverything.”\\n\\n“What was that, Harry?”\\n\\n“You said to me that Sibyl Vane represented to you all the heroines of\\nromance—that she was Desdemona one night, and Ophelia the other; that\\nif she died as Juliet, she came to life as Imogen.”\\n\\n“She will never come to life again now,” muttered the lad, burying his\\nface in his hands.\\n\\n“No, she will never come to life. She has played her last part. But you\\nmust think of that lonely death in the tawdry dressing-room simply as a\\nstrange lurid fragment from some Jacobean tragedy, as a wonderful scene\\nfrom Webster, or Ford, or Cyril Tourneur. The girl never really lived,\\nand so she has never really died. To you at least she was always a\\ndream, a phantom that flitted through Shakespeare’s plays and left them\\nlovelier for its presence, a reed through which Shakespeare’s music\\nsounded richer and more full of joy. The moment she touched actual\\nlife, she marred it, and it marred her, and so she passed away. Mourn\\nfor Ophelia, if you like. Put ashes on your head because Cordelia was\\nstrangled. Cry out against Heaven because the daughter of Brabantio\\ndied. But don’t waste your tears over Sibyl Vane. She was less real\\nthan they are.”\\n\\nThere was a silence. The evening darkened in the room. Noiselessly, and\\nwith silver feet, the shadows crept in from the garden. The colours\\nfaded wearily out of things.\\n\\nAfter some time Dorian Gray looked up. “You have explained me to\\nmyself, Harry,” he murmured with something of a sigh of relief. “I felt\\nall that you have said, but somehow I was afraid of it, and I could not\\nexpress it to myself. How well you know me! But we will not talk again\\nof what has happened. It has been a marvellous experience. That is all.\\nI wonder if life has still in store for me anything as marvellous.”\\n\\n“Life has everything in store for you, Dorian. There is nothing that\\nyou, with your extraordinary good looks, will not be able to do.”\\n\\n“But suppose, Harry, I became haggard, and old, and wrinkled? What\\nthen?”\\n\\n“Ah, then,” said Lord Henry, rising to go, “then, my dear Dorian, you\\nwould have to fight for your victories. As it is, they are brought to\\nyou. No, you must keep your good looks. We live in an age that reads\\ntoo much to be wise, and that thinks too much to be beautiful. We\\ncannot spare you. And now you had better dress and drive down to the\\nclub. We are rather late, as it is.”\\n\\n“I think I shall join you at the opera, Harry. I feel too tired to eat\\nanything. What is the number of your sister’s box?”\\n\\n“Twenty-seven, I believe. It is on the grand tier. You will see her\\nname on the door. But I am sorry you won’t come and dine.”\\n\\n“I don’t feel up to it,” said Dorian listlessly. “But I am awfully\\nobliged to you for all that you have said to me. You are certainly my\\nbest friend. No one has ever understood me as you have.”\\n\\n“We are only at the beginning of our friendship, Dorian,” answered Lord\\nHenry, shaking him by the hand. “Good-bye. I shall see you before\\nnine-thirty, I hope. Remember, Patti is singing.”\\n\\nAs he closed the door behind him, Dorian Gray touched the bell, and in\\na few minutes Victor appeared with the lamps and drew the blinds down.\\nHe waited impatiently for him to go. The man seemed to take an\\ninterminable time over everything.\\n\\nAs soon as he had left, he rushed to the screen and drew it back. No;\\nthere was no further change in the picture. It had received the news of\\nSibyl Vane’s death before he had known of it himself. It was conscious\\nof the events of life as they occurred. The vicious cruelty that marred\\nthe fine lines of the mouth had, no doubt, appeared at the very moment\\nthat the girl had drunk the poison, whatever it was. Or was it\\nindifferent to results? Did it merely take cognizance of what passed\\nwithin the soul? He wondered, and hoped that some day he would see the\\nchange taking place before his very eyes, shuddering as he hoped it.\\n\\nPoor Sibyl! What a romance it had all been! She had often mimicked\\ndeath on the stage. Then Death himself had touched her and taken her\\nwith him. How had she played that dreadful last scene? Had she cursed\\nhim, as she died? No; she had died for love of him, and love would\\nalways be a sacrament to him now. She had atoned for everything by the\\nsacrifice she had made of her life. He would not think any more of what\\nshe had made him go through, on that horrible night at the theatre.\\nWhen he thought of her, it would be as a wonderful tragic figure sent\\non to the world’s stage to show the supreme reality of love. A\\nwonderful tragic figure? Tears came to his eyes as he remembered her\\nchildlike look, and winsome fanciful ways, and shy tremulous grace. He\\nbrushed them away hastily and looked again at the picture.\\n\\nHe felt that the time had really come for making his choice. Or had his\\nchoice already been made? Yes, life had decided that for him—life, and\\nhis own infinite curiosity about life. Eternal youth, infinite passion,\\npleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder sins—he was to have\\nall these things. The portrait was to bear the burden of his shame:\\nthat was all.\\n\\nA feeling of pain crept over him as he thought of the desecration that\\nwas in store for the fair face on the canvas. Once, in boyish mockery\\nof Narcissus, he had kissed, or feigned to kiss, those painted lips\\nthat now smiled so cruelly at him. Morning after morning he had sat\\nbefore the portrait wondering at its beauty, almost enamoured of it, as\\nit seemed to him at times. Was it to alter now with every mood to which\\nhe yielded? Was it to become a monstrous and loathsome thing, to be\\nhidden away in a locked room, to be shut out from the sunlight that had\\nso often touched to brighter gold the waving wonder of its hair? The\\npity of it! the pity of it!\\n\\nFor a moment, he thought of praying that the horrible sympathy that\\nexisted between him and the picture might cease. It had changed in\\nanswer to a prayer; perhaps in answer to a prayer it might remain\\nunchanged. And yet, who, that knew anything about life, would surrender\\nthe chance of remaining always young, however fantastic that chance\\nmight be, or with what fateful consequences it might be fraught?\\nBesides, was it really under his control? Had it indeed been prayer\\nthat had produced the substitution? Might there not be some curious\\nscientific reason for it all? If thought could exercise its influence\\nupon a living organism, might not thought exercise an influence upon\\ndead and inorganic things? Nay, without thought or conscious desire,\\nmight not things external to ourselves vibrate in unison with our moods\\nand passions, atom calling to atom in secret love or strange affinity?\\nBut the reason was of no importance. He would never again tempt by a\\nprayer any terrible power. If the picture was to alter, it was to\\nalter. That was all. Why inquire too closely into it?\\n\\nFor there would be a real pleasure in watching it. He would be able to\\nfollow his mind into its secret places. This portrait would be to him\\nthe most magical of mirrors. As it had revealed to him his own body, so\\nit would reveal to him his own soul. And when winter came upon it, he\\nwould still be standing where spring trembles on the verge of summer.\\nWhen the blood crept from its face, and left behind a pallid mask of\\nchalk with leaden eyes, he would keep the glamour of boyhood. Not one\\nblossom of his loveliness would ever fade. Not one pulse of his life\\nwould ever weaken. Like the gods of the Greeks, he would be strong, and\\nfleet, and joyous. What did it matter what happened to the coloured\\nimage on the canvas? He would be safe. That was everything.\\n\\nHe drew the screen back into its former place in front of the picture,\\nsmiling as he did so, and passed into his bedroom, where his valet was\\nalready waiting for him. An hour later he was at the opera, and Lord\\nHenry was leaning over his chair.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX.\\n\\n\\nAs he was sitting at breakfast next morning, Basil Hallward was shown\\ninto the room.\\n\\n“I am so glad I have found you, Dorian,” he said gravely. “I called\\nlast night, and they told me you were at the opera. Of course, I knew\\nthat was impossible. But I wish you had left word where you had really\\ngone to. I passed a dreadful evening, half afraid that one tragedy\\nmight be followed by another. I think you might have telegraphed for me\\nwhen you heard of it first. I read of it quite by chance in a late\\nedition of _The Globe_ that I picked up at the club. I came here at\\nonce and was miserable at not finding you. I can’t tell you how\\nheart-broken I am about the whole thing. I know what you must suffer.\\nBut where were you? Did you go down and see the girl’s mother? For a\\nmoment I thought of following you there. They gave the address in the\\npaper. Somewhere in the Euston Road, isn’t it? But I was afraid of\\nintruding upon a sorrow that I could not lighten. Poor woman! What a\\nstate she must be in! And her only child, too! What did she say about\\nit all?”\\n\\n“My dear Basil, how do I know?” murmured Dorian Gray, sipping some\\npale-yellow wine from a delicate, gold-beaded bubble of Venetian glass\\nand looking dreadfully bored. “I was at the opera. You should have come\\non there. I met Lady Gwendolen, Harry’s sister, for the first time. We\\nwere in her box. She is perfectly charming; and Patti sang divinely.\\nDon’t talk about horrid subjects. If one doesn’t talk about a thing, it\\nhas never happened. It is simply expression, as Harry says, that gives\\nreality to things. I may mention that she was not the woman’s only\\nchild. There is a son, a charming fellow, I believe. But he is not on\\nthe stage. He is a sailor, or something. And now, tell me about\\nyourself and what you are painting.”\\n\\n“You went to the opera?” said Hallward, speaking very slowly and with a\\nstrained touch of pain in his voice. “You went to the opera while Sibyl\\nVane was lying dead in some sordid lodging? You can talk to me of other\\nwomen being charming, and of Patti singing divinely, before the girl\\nyou loved has even the quiet of a grave to sleep in? Why, man, there\\nare horrors in store for that little white body of hers!”\\n\\n“Stop, Basil! I won’t hear it!” cried Dorian, leaping to his feet. “You\\nmust not tell me about things. What is done is done. What is past is\\npast.”\\n\\n“You call yesterday the past?”\\n\\n“What has the actual lapse of time got to do with it? It is only\\nshallow people who require years to get rid of an emotion. A man who is\\nmaster of himself can end a sorrow as easily as he can invent a\\npleasure. I don’t want to be at the mercy of my emotions. I want to use\\nthem, to enjoy them, and to dominate them.”\\n\\n“Dorian, this is horrible! Something has changed you completely. You\\nlook exactly the same wonderful boy who, day after day, used to come\\ndown to my studio to sit for his picture. But you were simple, natural,\\nand affectionate then. You were the most unspoiled creature in the\\nwhole world. Now, I don’t know what has come over you. You talk as if\\nyou had no heart, no pity in you. It is all Harry’s influence. I see\\nthat.”\\n\\nThe lad flushed up and, going to the window, looked out for a few\\nmoments on the green, flickering, sun-lashed garden. “I owe a great\\ndeal to Harry, Basil,” he said at last, “more than I owe to you. You\\nonly taught me to be vain.”\\n\\n“Well, I am punished for that, Dorian—or shall be some day.”\\n\\n“I don’t know what you mean, Basil,” he exclaimed, turning round. “I\\ndon’t know what you want. What do you want?”\\n\\n“I want the Dorian Gray I used to paint,” said the artist sadly.\\n\\n“Basil,” said the lad, going over to him and putting his hand on his\\nshoulder, “you have come too late. Yesterday, when I heard that Sibyl\\nVane had killed herself—”\\n\\n“Killed herself! Good heavens! is there no doubt about that?” cried\\nHallward, looking up at him with an expression of horror.\\n\\n“My dear Basil! Surely you don’t think it was a vulgar accident? Of\\ncourse she killed herself.”\\n\\nThe elder man buried his face in his hands. “How fearful,” he muttered,\\nand a shudder ran through him.\\n\\n“No,” said Dorian Gray, “there is nothing fearful about it. It is one\\nof the great romantic tragedies of the age. As a rule, people who act\\nlead the most commonplace lives. They are good husbands, or faithful\\nwives, or something tedious. You know what I mean—middle-class virtue\\nand all that kind of thing. How different Sibyl was! She lived her\\nfinest tragedy. She was always a heroine. The last night she played—the\\nnight you saw her—she acted badly because she had known the reality of\\nlove. When she knew its unreality, she died, as Juliet might have died.\\nShe passed again into the sphere of art. There is something of the\\nmartyr about her. Her death has all the pathetic uselessness of\\nmartyrdom, all its wasted beauty. But, as I was saying, you must not\\nthink I have not suffered. If you had come in yesterday at a particular\\nmoment—about half-past five, perhaps, or a quarter to six—you would\\nhave found me in tears. Even Harry, who was here, who brought me the\\nnews, in fact, had no idea what I was going through. I suffered\\nimmensely. Then it passed away. I cannot repeat an emotion. No one can,\\nexcept sentimentalists. And you are awfully unjust, Basil. You come\\ndown here to console me. That is charming of you. You find me consoled,\\nand you are furious. How like a sympathetic person! You remind me of a\\nstory Harry told me about a certain philanthropist who spent twenty\\nyears of his life in trying to get some grievance redressed, or some\\nunjust law altered—I forget exactly what it was. Finally he succeeded,\\nand nothing could exceed his disappointment. He had absolutely nothing\\nto do, almost died of _ennui_, and became a confirmed misanthrope. And\\nbesides, my dear old Basil, if you really want to console me, teach me\\nrather to forget what has happened, or to see it from a proper artistic\\npoint of view. Was it not Gautier who used to write about _la\\nconsolation des arts_? I remember picking up a little vellum-covered\\nbook in your studio one day and chancing on that delightful phrase.\\nWell, I am not like that young man you told me of when we were down at\\nMarlow together, the young man who used to say that yellow satin could\\nconsole one for all the miseries of life. I love beautiful things that\\none can touch and handle. Old brocades, green bronzes, lacquer-work,\\ncarved ivories, exquisite surroundings, luxury, pomp—there is much to\\nbe got from all these. But the artistic temperament that they create,\\nor at any rate reveal, is still more to me. To become the spectator of\\none’s own life, as Harry says, is to escape the suffering of life. I\\nknow you are surprised at my talking to you like this. You have not\\nrealized how I have developed. I was a schoolboy when you knew me. I am\\na man now. I have new passions, new thoughts, new ideas. I am\\ndifferent, but you must not like me less. I am changed, but you must\\nalways be my friend. Of course, I am very fond of Harry. But I know\\nthat you are better than he is. You are not stronger—you are too much\\nafraid of life—but you are better. And how happy we used to be\\ntogether! Don’t leave me, Basil, and don’t quarrel with me. I am what I\\nam. There is nothing more to be said.”\\n\\nThe painter felt strangely moved. The lad was infinitely dear to him,\\nand his personality had been the great turning point in his art. He\\ncould not bear the idea of reproaching him any more. After all, his\\nindifference was probably merely a mood that would pass away. There was\\nso much in him that was good, so much in him that was noble.\\n\\n“Well, Dorian,” he said at length, with a sad smile, “I won’t speak to\\nyou again about this horrible thing, after to-day. I only trust your\\nname won’t be mentioned in connection with it. The inquest is to take\\nplace this afternoon. Have they summoned you?”\\n\\nDorian shook his head, and a look of annoyance passed over his face at\\nthe mention of the word “inquest.” There was something so crude and\\nvulgar about everything of the kind. “They don’t know my name,” he\\nanswered.\\n\\n“But surely she did?”\\n\\n“Only my Christian name, and that I am quite sure she never mentioned\\nto any one. She told me once that they were all rather curious to learn\\nwho I was, and that she invariably told them my name was Prince\\nCharming. It was pretty of her. You must do me a drawing of Sibyl,\\nBasil. I should like to have something more of her than the memory of a\\nfew kisses and some broken pathetic words.”\\n\\n“I will try and do something, Dorian, if it would please you. But you\\nmust come and sit to me yourself again. I can’t get on without you.”\\n\\n“I can never sit to you again, Basil. It is impossible!” he exclaimed,\\nstarting back.\\n\\nThe painter stared at him. “My dear boy, what nonsense!” he cried. “Do\\nyou mean to say you don’t like what I did of you? Where is it? Why have\\nyou pulled the screen in front of it? Let me look at it. It is the best\\nthing I have ever done. Do take the screen away, Dorian. It is simply\\ndisgraceful of your servant hiding my work like that. I felt the room\\nlooked different as I came in.”\\n\\n“My servant has nothing to do with it, Basil. You don’t imagine I let\\nhim arrange my room for me? He settles my flowers for me sometimes—that\\nis all. No; I did it myself. The light was too strong on the portrait.”\\n\\n“Too strong! Surely not, my dear fellow? It is an admirable place for\\nit. Let me see it.” And Hallward walked towards the corner of the room.\\n\\nA cry of terror broke from Dorian Gray’s lips, and he rushed between\\nthe painter and the screen. “Basil,” he said, looking very pale, “you\\nmust not look at it. I don’t wish you to.”\\n\\n“Not look at my own work! You are not serious. Why shouldn’t I look at\\nit?” exclaimed Hallward, laughing.\\n\\n“If you try to look at it, Basil, on my word of honour I will never\\nspeak to you again as long as I live. I am quite serious. I don’t offer\\nany explanation, and you are not to ask for any. But, remember, if you\\ntouch this screen, everything is over between us.”\\n\\nHallward was thunderstruck. He looked at Dorian Gray in absolute\\namazement. He had never seen him like this before. The lad was actually\\npallid with rage. His hands were clenched, and the pupils of his eyes\\nwere like disks of blue fire. He was trembling all over.\\n\\n“Dorian!”\\n\\n“Don’t speak!”\\n\\n“But what is the matter? Of course I won’t look at it if you don’t want\\nme to,” he said, rather coldly, turning on his heel and going over\\ntowards the window. “But, really, it seems rather absurd that I\\nshouldn’t see my own work, especially as I am going to exhibit it in\\nParis in the autumn. I shall probably have to give it another coat of\\nvarnish before that, so I must see it some day, and why not to-day?”\\n\\n“To exhibit it! You want to exhibit it?” exclaimed Dorian Gray, a\\nstrange sense of terror creeping over him. Was the world going to be\\nshown his secret? Were people to gape at the mystery of his life? That\\nwas impossible. Something—he did not know what—had to be done at once.\\n\\n“Yes; I don’t suppose you will object to that. Georges Petit is going\\nto collect all my best pictures for a special exhibition in the Rue de\\nSèze, which will open the first week in October. The portrait will only\\nbe away a month. I should think you could easily spare it for that\\ntime. In fact, you are sure to be out of town. And if you keep it\\nalways behind a screen, you can’t care much about it.”\\n\\nDorian Gray passed his hand over his forehead. There were beads of\\nperspiration there. He felt that he was on the brink of a horrible\\ndanger. “You told me a month ago that you would never exhibit it,” he\\ncried. “Why have you changed your mind? You people who go in for being\\nconsistent have just as many moods as others have. The only difference\\nis that your moods are rather meaningless. You can’t have forgotten\\nthat you assured me most solemnly that nothing in the world would\\ninduce you to send it to any exhibition. You told Harry exactly the\\nsame thing.” He stopped suddenly, and a gleam of light came into his\\neyes. He remembered that Lord Henry had said to him once, half\\nseriously and half in jest, “If you want to have a strange quarter of\\nan hour, get Basil to tell you why he won’t exhibit your picture. He\\ntold me why he wouldn’t, and it was a revelation to me.” Yes, perhaps\\nBasil, too, had his secret. He would ask him and try.\\n\\n“Basil,” he said, coming over quite close and looking him straight in\\nthe face, “we have each of us a secret. Let me know yours, and I shall\\ntell you mine. What was your reason for refusing to exhibit my\\npicture?”\\n\\nThe painter shuddered in spite of himself. “Dorian, if I told you, you\\nmight like me less than you do, and you would certainly laugh at me. I\\ncould not bear your doing either of those two things. If you wish me\\nnever to look at your picture again, I am content. I have always you to\\nlook at. If you wish the best work I have ever done to be hidden from\\nthe world, I am satisfied. Your friendship is dearer to me than any\\nfame or reputation.”\\n\\n“No, Basil, you must tell me,” insisted Dorian Gray. “I think I have a\\nright to know.” His feeling of terror had passed away, and curiosity\\nhad taken its place. He was determined to find out Basil Hallward’s\\nmystery.\\n\\n“Let us sit down, Dorian,” said the painter, looking troubled. “Let us\\nsit down. And just answer me one question. Have you noticed in the\\npicture something curious?—something that probably at first did not\\nstrike you, but that revealed itself to you suddenly?”\\n\\n“Basil!” cried the lad, clutching the arms of his chair with trembling\\nhands and gazing at him with wild startled eyes.\\n\\n“I see you did. Don’t speak. Wait till you hear what I have to say.\\nDorian, from the moment I met you, your personality had the most\\nextraordinary influence over me. I was dominated, soul, brain, and\\npower, by you. You became to me the visible incarnation of that unseen\\nideal whose memory haunts us artists like an exquisite dream. I\\nworshipped you. I grew jealous of every one to whom you spoke. I wanted\\nto have you all to myself. I was only happy when I was with you. When\\nyou were away from me, you were still present in my art.... Of course,\\nI never let you know anything about this. It would have been\\nimpossible. You would not have understood it. I hardly understood it\\nmyself. I only knew that I had seen perfection face to face, and that\\nthe world had become wonderful to my eyes—too wonderful, perhaps, for\\nin such mad worships there is peril, the peril of losing them, no less\\nthan the peril of keeping them.... Weeks and weeks went on, and I grew\\nmore and more absorbed in you. Then came a new development. I had drawn\\nyou as Paris in dainty armour, and as Adonis with huntsman’s cloak and\\npolished boar-spear. Crowned with heavy lotus-blossoms you had sat on\\nthe prow of Adrian’s barge, gazing across the green turbid Nile. You\\nhad leaned over the still pool of some Greek woodland and seen in the\\nwater’s silent silver the marvel of your own face. And it had all been\\nwhat art should be—unconscious, ideal, and remote. One day, a fatal day\\nI sometimes think, I determined to paint a wonderful portrait of you as\\nyou actually are, not in the costume of dead ages, but in your own\\ndress and in your own time. Whether it was the realism of the method,\\nor the mere wonder of your own personality, thus directly presented to\\nme without mist or veil, I cannot tell. But I know that as I worked at\\nit, every flake and film of colour seemed to me to reveal my secret. I\\ngrew afraid that others would know of my idolatry. I felt, Dorian, that\\nI had told too much, that I had put too much of myself into it. Then it\\nwas that I resolved never to allow the picture to be exhibited. You\\nwere a little annoyed; but then you did not realize all that it meant\\nto me. Harry, to whom I talked about it, laughed at me. But I did not\\nmind that. When the picture was finished, and I sat alone with it, I\\nfelt that I was right.... Well, after a few days the thing left my\\nstudio, and as soon as I had got rid of the intolerable fascination of\\nits presence, it seemed to me that I had been foolish in imagining that\\nI had seen anything in it, more than that you were extremely\\ngood-looking and that I could paint. Even now I cannot help feeling\\nthat it is a mistake to think that the passion one feels in creation is\\never really shown in the work one creates. Art is always more abstract\\nthan we fancy. Form and colour tell us of form and colour—that is all.\\nIt often seems to me that art conceals the artist far more completely\\nthan it ever reveals him. And so when I got this offer from Paris, I\\ndetermined to make your portrait the principal thing in my exhibition.\\nIt never occurred to me that you would refuse. I see now that you were\\nright. The picture cannot be shown. You must not be angry with me,\\nDorian, for what I have told you. As I said to Harry, once, you are\\nmade to be worshipped.”\\n\\nDorian Gray drew a long breath. The colour came back to his cheeks, and\\na smile played about his lips. The peril was over. He was safe for the\\ntime. Yet he could not help feeling infinite pity for the painter who\\nhad just made this strange confession to him, and wondered if he\\nhimself would ever be so dominated by the personality of a friend. Lord\\nHenry had the charm of being very dangerous. But that was all. He was\\ntoo clever and too cynical to be really fond of. Would there ever be\\nsome one who would fill him with a strange idolatry? Was that one of\\nthe things that life had in store?\\n\\n“It is extraordinary to me, Dorian,” said Hallward, “that you should\\nhave seen this in the portrait. Did you really see it?”\\n\\n“I saw something in it,” he answered, “something that seemed to me very\\ncurious.”\\n\\n“Well, you don’t mind my looking at the thing now?”\\n\\nDorian shook his head. “You must not ask me that, Basil. I could not\\npossibly let you stand in front of that picture.”\\n\\n“You will some day, surely?”\\n\\n“Never.”\\n\\n“Well, perhaps you are right. And now good-bye, Dorian. You have been\\nthe one person in my life who has really influenced my art. Whatever I\\nhave done that is good, I owe to you. Ah! you don’t know what it cost\\nme to tell you all that I have told you.”\\n\\n“My dear Basil,” said Dorian, “what have you told me? Simply that you\\nfelt that you admired me too much. That is not even a compliment.”\\n\\n“It was not intended as a compliment. It was a confession. Now that I\\nhave made it, something seems to have gone out of me. Perhaps one\\nshould never put one’s worship into words.”\\n\\n“It was a very disappointing confession.”\\n\\n“Why, what did you expect, Dorian? You didn’t see anything else in the\\npicture, did you? There was nothing else to see?”\\n\\n“No; there was nothing else to see. Why do you ask? But you mustn’t\\ntalk about worship. It is foolish. You and I are friends, Basil, and we\\nmust always remain so.”\\n\\n“You have got Harry,” said the painter sadly.\\n\\n“Oh, Harry!” cried the lad, with a ripple of laughter. “Harry spends\\nhis days in saying what is incredible and his evenings in doing what is\\nimprobable. Just the sort of life I would like to lead. But still I\\ndon’t think I would go to Harry if I were in trouble. I would sooner go\\nto you, Basil.”\\n\\n“You will sit to me again?”\\n\\n“Impossible!”\\n\\n“You spoil my life as an artist by refusing, Dorian. No man comes\\nacross two ideal things. Few come across one.”\\n\\n“I can’t explain it to you, Basil, but I must never sit to you again.\\nThere is something fatal about a portrait. It has a life of its own. I\\nwill come and have tea with you. That will be just as pleasant.”\\n\\n“Pleasanter for you, I am afraid,” murmured Hallward regretfully. “And\\nnow good-bye. I am sorry you won’t let me look at the picture once\\nagain. But that can’t be helped. I quite understand what you feel about\\nit.”\\n\\nAs he left the room, Dorian Gray smiled to himself. Poor Basil! How\\nlittle he knew of the true reason! And how strange it was that, instead\\nof having been forced to reveal his own secret, he had succeeded,\\nalmost by chance, in wresting a secret from his friend! How much that\\nstrange confession explained to him! The painter’s absurd fits of\\njealousy, his wild devotion, his extravagant panegyrics, his curious\\nreticences—he understood them all now, and he felt sorry. There seemed\\nto him to be something tragic in a friendship so coloured by romance.\\n\\nHe sighed and touched the bell. The portrait must be hidden away at all\\ncosts. He could not run such a risk of discovery again. It had been mad\\nof him to have allowed the thing to remain, even for an hour, in a room\\nto which any of his friends had access.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X.\\n\\n\\nWhen his servant entered, he looked at him steadfastly and wondered if\\nhe had thought of peering behind the screen. The man was quite\\nimpassive and waited for his orders. Dorian lit a cigarette and walked\\nover to the glass and glanced into it. He could see the reflection of\\nVictor’s face perfectly. It was like a placid mask of servility. There\\nwas nothing to be afraid of, there. Yet he thought it best to be on his\\nguard.\\n\\nSpeaking very slowly, he told him to tell the house-keeper that he\\nwanted to see her, and then to go to the frame-maker and ask him to\\nsend two of his men round at once. It seemed to him that as the man\\nleft the room his eyes wandered in the direction of the screen. Or was\\nthat merely his own fancy?\\n\\nAfter a few moments, in her black silk dress, with old-fashioned thread\\nmittens on her wrinkled hands, Mrs. Leaf bustled into the library. He\\nasked her for the key of the schoolroom.\\n\\n“The old schoolroom, Mr. Dorian?” she exclaimed. “Why, it is full of\\ndust. I must get it arranged and put straight before you go into it. It\\nis not fit for you to see, sir. It is not, indeed.”\\n\\n“I don’t want it put straight, Leaf. I only want the key.”\\n\\n“Well, sir, you’ll be covered with cobwebs if you go into it. Why, it\\nhasn’t been opened for nearly five years—not since his lordship died.”\\n\\nHe winced at the mention of his grandfather. He had hateful memories of\\nhim. “That does not matter,” he answered. “I simply want to see the\\nplace—that is all. Give me the key.”\\n\\n“And here is the key, sir,” said the old lady, going over the contents\\nof her bunch with tremulously uncertain hands. “Here is the key. I’ll\\nhave it off the bunch in a moment. But you don’t think of living up\\nthere, sir, and you so comfortable here?”\\n\\n“No, no,” he cried petulantly. “Thank you, Leaf. That will do.”\\n\\nShe lingered for a few moments, and was garrulous over some detail of\\nthe household. He sighed and told her to manage things as she thought\\nbest. She left the room, wreathed in smiles.\\n\\nAs the door closed, Dorian put the key in his pocket and looked round\\nthe room. His eye fell on a large, purple satin coverlet heavily\\nembroidered with gold, a splendid piece of late seventeenth-century\\nVenetian work that his grandfather had found in a convent near Bologna.\\nYes, that would serve to wrap the dreadful thing in. It had perhaps\\nserved often as a pall for the dead. Now it was to hide something that\\nhad a corruption of its own, worse than the corruption of death\\nitself—something that would breed horrors and yet would never die. What\\nthe worm was to the corpse, his sins would be to the painted image on\\nthe canvas. They would mar its beauty and eat away its grace. They\\nwould defile it and make it shameful. And yet the thing would still\\nlive on. It would be always alive.\\n\\nHe shuddered, and for a moment he regretted that he had not told Basil\\nthe true reason why he had wished to hide the picture away. Basil would\\nhave helped him to resist Lord Henry’s influence, and the still more\\npoisonous influences that came from his own temperament. The love that\\nhe bore him—for it was really love—had nothing in it that was not noble\\nand intellectual. It was not that mere physical admiration of beauty\\nthat is born of the senses and that dies when the senses tire. It was\\nsuch love as Michelangelo had known, and Montaigne, and Winckelmann,\\nand Shakespeare himself. Yes, Basil could have saved him. But it was\\ntoo late now. The past could always be annihilated. Regret, denial, or\\nforgetfulness could do that. But the future was inevitable. There were\\npassions in him that would find their terrible outlet, dreams that\\nwould make the shadow of their evil real.\\n\\nHe took up from the couch the great purple-and-gold texture that\\ncovered it, and, holding it in his hands, passed behind the screen. Was\\nthe face on the canvas viler than before? It seemed to him that it was\\nunchanged, and yet his loathing of it was intensified. Gold hair, blue\\neyes, and rose-red lips—they all were there. It was simply the\\nexpression that had altered. That was horrible in its cruelty. Compared\\nto what he saw in it of censure or rebuke, how shallow Basil’s\\nreproaches about Sibyl Vane had been!—how shallow, and of what little\\naccount! His own soul was looking out at him from the canvas and\\ncalling him to judgement. A look of pain came across him, and he flung\\nthe rich pall over the picture. As he did so, a knock came to the door.\\nHe passed out as his servant entered.\\n\\n“The persons are here, Monsieur.”\\n\\nHe felt that the man must be got rid of at once. He must not be allowed\\nto know where the picture was being taken to. There was something sly\\nabout him, and he had thoughtful, treacherous eyes. Sitting down at the\\nwriting-table he scribbled a note to Lord Henry, asking him to send him\\nround something to read and reminding him that they were to meet at\\neight-fifteen that evening.\\n\\n“Wait for an answer,” he said, handing it to him, “and show the men in\\nhere.”\\n\\nIn two or three minutes there was another knock, and Mr. Hubbard\\nhimself, the celebrated frame-maker of South Audley Street, came in\\nwith a somewhat rough-looking young assistant. Mr. Hubbard was a\\nflorid, red-whiskered little man, whose admiration for art was\\nconsiderably tempered by the inveterate impecuniosity of most of the\\nartists who dealt with him. As a rule, he never left his shop. He\\nwaited for people to come to him. But he always made an exception in\\nfavour of Dorian Gray. There was something about Dorian that charmed\\neverybody. It was a pleasure even to see him.\\n\\n“What can I do for you, Mr. Gray?” he said, rubbing his fat freckled\\nhands. “I thought I would do myself the honour of coming round in\\nperson. I have just got a beauty of a frame, sir. Picked it up at a\\nsale. Old Florentine. Came from Fonthill, I believe. Admirably suited\\nfor a religious subject, Mr. Gray.”\\n\\n“I am so sorry you have given yourself the trouble of coming round, Mr.\\nHubbard. I shall certainly drop in and look at the frame—though I don’t\\ngo in much at present for religious art—but to-day I only want a\\npicture carried to the top of the house for me. It is rather heavy, so\\nI thought I would ask you to lend me a couple of your men.”\\n\\n“No trouble at all, Mr. Gray. I am delighted to be of any service to\\nyou. Which is the work of art, sir?”\\n\\n“This,” replied Dorian, moving the screen back. “Can you move it,\\ncovering and all, just as it is? I don’t want it to get scratched going\\nupstairs.”\\n\\n“There will be no difficulty, sir,” said the genial frame-maker,\\nbeginning, with the aid of his assistant, to unhook the picture from\\nthe long brass chains by which it was suspended. “And, now, where shall\\nwe carry it to, Mr. Gray?”\\n\\n“I will show you the way, Mr. Hubbard, if you will kindly follow me. Or\\nperhaps you had better go in front. I am afraid it is right at the top\\nof the house. We will go up by the front staircase, as it is wider.”\\n\\nHe held the door open for them, and they passed out into the hall and\\nbegan the ascent. The elaborate character of the frame had made the\\npicture extremely bulky, and now and then, in spite of the obsequious\\nprotests of Mr. Hubbard, who had the true tradesman’s spirited dislike\\nof seeing a gentleman doing anything useful, Dorian put his hand to it\\nso as to help them.\\n\\n“Something of a load to carry, sir,” gasped the little man when they\\nreached the top landing. And he wiped his shiny forehead.\\n\\n“I am afraid it is rather heavy,” murmured Dorian as he unlocked the\\ndoor that opened into the room that was to keep for him the curious\\nsecret of his life and hide his soul from the eyes of men.\\n\\nHe had not entered the place for more than four years—not, indeed,\\nsince he had used it first as a play-room when he was a child, and then\\nas a study when he grew somewhat older. It was a large,\\nwell-proportioned room, which had been specially built by the last Lord\\nKelso for the use of the little grandson whom, for his strange likeness\\nto his mother, and also for other reasons, he had always hated and\\ndesired to keep at a distance. It appeared to Dorian to have but little\\nchanged. There was the huge Italian _cassone_, with its fantastically\\npainted panels and its tarnished gilt mouldings, in which he had so\\noften hidden himself as a boy. There the satinwood book-case filled\\nwith his dog-eared schoolbooks. On the wall behind it was hanging the\\nsame ragged Flemish tapestry where a faded king and queen were playing\\nchess in a garden, while a company of hawkers rode by, carrying hooded\\nbirds on their gauntleted wrists. How well he remembered it all! Every\\nmoment of his lonely childhood came back to him as he looked round. He\\nrecalled the stainless purity of his boyish life, and it seemed\\nhorrible to him that it was here the fatal portrait was to be hidden\\naway. How little he had thought, in those dead days, of all that was in\\nstore for him!\\n\\nBut there was no other place in the house so secure from prying eyes as\\nthis. He had the key, and no one else could enter it. Beneath its\\npurple pall, the face painted on the canvas could grow bestial, sodden,\\nand unclean. What did it matter? No one could see it. He himself would\\nnot see it. Why should he watch the hideous corruption of his soul? He\\nkept his youth—that was enough. And, besides, might not his nature grow\\nfiner, after all? There was no reason that the future should be so full\\nof shame. Some love might come across his life, and purify him, and\\nshield him from those sins that seemed to be already stirring in spirit\\nand in flesh—those curious unpictured sins whose very mystery lent them\\ntheir subtlety and their charm. Perhaps, some day, the cruel look would\\nhave passed away from the scarlet sensitive mouth, and he might show to\\nthe world Basil Hallward’s masterpiece.\\n\\nNo; that was impossible. Hour by hour, and week by week, the thing upon\\nthe canvas was growing old. It might escape the hideousness of sin, but\\nthe hideousness of age was in store for it. The cheeks would become\\nhollow or flaccid. Yellow crow’s feet would creep round the fading eyes\\nand make them horrible. The hair would lose its brightness, the mouth\\nwould gape or droop, would be foolish or gross, as the mouths of old\\nmen are. There would be the wrinkled throat, the cold, blue-veined\\nhands, the twisted body, that he remembered in the grandfather who had\\nbeen so stern to him in his boyhood. The picture had to be concealed.\\nThere was no help for it.\\n\\n“Bring it in, Mr. Hubbard, please,” he said, wearily, turning round. “I\\nam sorry I kept you so long. I was thinking of something else.”\\n\\n“Always glad to have a rest, Mr. Gray,” answered the frame-maker, who\\nwas still gasping for breath. “Where shall we put it, sir?”\\n\\n“Oh, anywhere. Here: this will do. I don’t want to have it hung up.\\nJust lean it against the wall. Thanks.”\\n\\n“Might one look at the work of art, sir?”\\n\\nDorian started. “It would not interest you, Mr. Hubbard,” he said,\\nkeeping his eye on the man. He felt ready to leap upon him and fling\\nhim to the ground if he dared to lift the gorgeous hanging that\\nconcealed the secret of his life. “I shan’t trouble you any more now. I\\nam much obliged for your kindness in coming round.”\\n\\n“Not at all, not at all, Mr. Gray. Ever ready to do anything for you,\\nsir.” And Mr. Hubbard tramped downstairs, followed by the assistant,\\nwho glanced back at Dorian with a look of shy wonder in his rough\\nuncomely face. He had never seen any one so marvellous.\\n\\nWhen the sound of their footsteps had died away, Dorian locked the door\\nand put the key in his pocket. He felt safe now. No one would ever look\\nupon the horrible thing. No eye but his would ever see his shame.\\n\\nOn reaching the library, he found that it was just after five o’clock\\nand that the tea had been already brought up. On a little table of dark\\nperfumed wood thickly incrusted with nacre, a present from Lady Radley,\\nhis guardian’s wife, a pretty professional invalid who had spent the\\npreceding winter in Cairo, was lying a note from Lord Henry, and beside\\nit was a book bound in yellow paper, the cover slightly torn and the\\nedges soiled. A copy of the third edition of _The St. James’s Gazette_\\nhad been placed on the tea-tray. It was evident that Victor had\\nreturned. He wondered if he had met the men in the hall as they were\\nleaving the house and had wormed out of them what they had been doing.\\nHe would be sure to miss the picture—had no doubt missed it already,\\nwhile he had been laying the tea-things. The screen had not been set\\nback, and a blank space was visible on the wall. Perhaps some night he\\nmight find him creeping upstairs and trying to force the door of the\\nroom. It was a horrible thing to have a spy in one’s house. He had\\nheard of rich men who had been blackmailed all their lives by some\\nservant who had read a letter, or overheard a conversation, or picked\\nup a card with an address, or found beneath a pillow a withered flower\\nor a shred of crumpled lace.\\n\\nHe sighed, and having poured himself out some tea, opened Lord Henry’s\\nnote. It was simply to say that he sent him round the evening paper,\\nand a book that might interest him, and that he would be at the club at\\neight-fifteen. He opened _The St. James’s_ languidly, and looked\\nthrough it. A red pencil-mark on the fifth page caught his eye. It drew\\nattention to the following paragraph:\\n\\nINQUEST ON AN ACTRESS.—An inquest was held this morning at the Bell\\nTavern, Hoxton Road, by Mr. Danby, the District Coroner, on the body of\\nSibyl Vane, a young actress recently engaged at the Royal Theatre,\\nHolborn. A verdict of death by misadventure was returned. Considerable\\nsympathy was expressed for the mother of the deceased, who was greatly\\naffected during the giving of her own evidence, and that of Dr.\\nBirrell, who had made the post-mortem examination of the deceased.\\n\\n\\nHe frowned, and tearing the paper in two, went across the room and\\nflung the pieces away. How ugly it all was! And how horribly real\\nugliness made things! He felt a little annoyed with Lord Henry for\\nhaving sent him the report. And it was certainly stupid of him to have\\nmarked it with red pencil. Victor might have read it. The man knew more\\nthan enough English for that.\\n\\nPerhaps he had read it and had begun to suspect something. And, yet,\\nwhat did it matter? What had Dorian Gray to do with Sibyl Vane’s death?\\nThere was nothing to fear. Dorian Gray had not killed her.\\n\\nHis eye fell on the yellow book that Lord Henry had sent him. What was\\nit, he wondered. He went towards the little, pearl-coloured octagonal\\nstand that had always looked to him like the work of some strange\\nEgyptian bees that wrought in silver, and taking up the volume, flung\\nhimself into an arm-chair and began to turn over the leaves. After a\\nfew minutes he became absorbed. It was the strangest book that he had\\never read. It seemed to him that in exquisite raiment, and to the\\ndelicate sound of flutes, the sins of the world were passing in dumb\\nshow before him. Things that he had dimly dreamed of were suddenly made\\nreal to him. Things of which he had never dreamed were gradually\\nrevealed.\\n\\nIt was a novel without a plot and with only one character, being,\\nindeed, simply a psychological study of a certain young Parisian who\\nspent his life trying to realize in the nineteenth century all the\\npassions and modes of thought that belonged to every century except his\\nown, and to sum up, as it were, in himself the various moods through\\nwhich the world-spirit had ever passed, loving for their mere\\nartificiality those renunciations that men have unwisely called virtue,\\nas much as those natural rebellions that wise men still call sin. The\\nstyle in which it was written was that curious jewelled style, vivid\\nand obscure at once, full of _argot_ and of archaisms, of technical\\nexpressions and of elaborate paraphrases, that characterizes the work\\nof some of the finest artists of the French school of _Symbolistes_.\\nThere were in it metaphors as monstrous as orchids and as subtle in\\ncolour. The life of the senses was described in the terms of mystical\\nphilosophy. One hardly knew at times whether one was reading the\\nspiritual ecstasies of some mediæval saint or the morbid confessions of\\na modern sinner. It was a poisonous book. The heavy odour of incense\\nseemed to cling about its pages and to trouble the brain. The mere\\ncadence of the sentences, the subtle monotony of their music, so full\\nas it was of complex refrains and movements elaborately repeated,\\nproduced in the mind of the lad, as he passed from chapter to chapter,\\na form of reverie, a malady of dreaming, that made him unconscious of\\nthe falling day and creeping shadows.\\n\\nCloudless, and pierced by one solitary star, a copper-green sky gleamed\\nthrough the windows. He read on by its wan light till he could read no\\nmore. Then, after his valet had reminded him several times of the\\nlateness of the hour, he got up, and going into the next room, placed\\nthe book on the little Florentine table that always stood at his\\nbedside and began to dress for dinner.\\n\\nIt was almost nine o’clock before he reached the club, where he found\\nLord Henry sitting alone, in the morning-room, looking very much bored.\\n\\n“I am so sorry, Harry,” he cried, “but really it is entirely your\\nfault. That book you sent me so fascinated me that I forgot how the\\ntime was going.”\\n\\n“Yes, I thought you would like it,” replied his host, rising from his\\nchair.\\n\\n“I didn’t say I liked it, Harry. I said it fascinated me. There is a\\ngreat difference.”\\n\\n“Ah, you have discovered that?” murmured Lord Henry. And they passed\\ninto the dining-room.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI.\\n\\n\\nFor years, Dorian Gray could not free himself from the influence of\\nthis book. Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he never\\nsought to free himself from it. He procured from Paris no less than\\nnine large-paper copies of the first edition, and had them bound in\\ndifferent colours, so that they might suit his various moods and the\\nchanging fancies of a nature over which he seemed, at times, to have\\nalmost entirely lost control. The hero, the wonderful young Parisian in\\nwhom the romantic and the scientific temperaments were so strangely\\nblended, became to him a kind of prefiguring type of himself. And,\\nindeed, the whole book seemed to him to contain the story of his own\\nlife, written before he had lived it.\\n\\nIn one point he was more fortunate than the novel’s fantastic hero. He\\nnever knew—never, indeed, had any cause to know—that somewhat grotesque\\ndread of mirrors, and polished metal surfaces, and still water which\\ncame upon the young Parisian so early in his life, and was occasioned\\nby the sudden decay of a beau that had once, apparently, been so\\nremarkable. It was with an almost cruel joy—and perhaps in nearly every\\njoy, as certainly in every pleasure, cruelty has its place—that he used\\nto read the latter part of the book, with its really tragic, if\\nsomewhat overemphasized, account of the sorrow and despair of one who\\nhad himself lost what in others, and the world, he had most dearly\\nvalued.\\n\\nFor the wonderful beauty that had so fascinated Basil Hallward, and\\nmany others besides him, seemed never to leave him. Even those who had\\nheard the most evil things against him—and from time to time strange\\nrumours about his mode of life crept through London and became the\\nchatter of the clubs—could not believe anything to his dishonour when\\nthey saw him. He had always the look of one who had kept himself\\nunspotted from the world. Men who talked grossly became silent when\\nDorian Gray entered the room. There was something in the purity of his\\nface that rebuked them. His mere presence seemed to recall to them the\\nmemory of the innocence that they had tarnished. They wondered how one\\nso charming and graceful as he was could have escaped the stain of an\\nage that was at once sordid and sensual.\\n\\nOften, on returning home from one of those mysterious and prolonged\\nabsences that gave rise to such strange conjecture among those who were\\nhis friends, or thought that they were so, he himself would creep\\nupstairs to the locked room, open the door with the key that never left\\nhim now, and stand, with a mirror, in front of the portrait that Basil\\nHallward had painted of him, looking now at the evil and aging face on\\nthe canvas, and now at the fair young face that laughed back at him\\nfrom the polished glass. The very sharpness of the contrast used to\\nquicken his sense of pleasure. He grew more and more enamoured of his\\nown beauty, more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul.\\nHe would examine with minute care, and sometimes with a monstrous and\\nterrible delight, the hideous lines that seared the wrinkling forehead\\nor crawled around the heavy sensual mouth, wondering sometimes which\\nwere the more horrible, the signs of sin or the signs of age. He would\\nplace his white hands beside the coarse bloated hands of the picture,\\nand smile. He mocked the misshapen body and the failing limbs.\\n\\nThere were moments, indeed, at night, when, lying sleepless in his own\\ndelicately scented chamber, or in the sordid room of the little\\nill-famed tavern near the docks which, under an assumed name and in\\ndisguise, it was his habit to frequent, he would think of the ruin he\\nhad brought upon his soul with a pity that was all the more poignant\\nbecause it was purely selfish. But moments such as these were rare.\\nThat curiosity about life which Lord Henry had first stirred in him, as\\nthey sat together in the garden of their friend, seemed to increase\\nwith gratification. The more he knew, the more he desired to know. He\\nhad mad hungers that grew more ravenous as he fed them.\\n\\nYet he was not really reckless, at any rate in his relations to\\nsociety. Once or twice every month during the winter, and on each\\nWednesday evening while the season lasted, he would throw open to the\\nworld his beautiful house and have the most celebrated musicians of the\\nday to charm his guests with the wonders of their art. His little\\ndinners, in the settling of which Lord Henry always assisted him, were\\nnoted as much for the careful selection and placing of those invited,\\nas for the exquisite taste shown in the decoration of the table, with\\nits subtle symphonic arrangements of exotic flowers, and embroidered\\ncloths, and antique plate of gold and silver. Indeed, there were many,\\nespecially among the very young men, who saw, or fancied that they saw,\\nin Dorian Gray the true realization of a type of which they had often\\ndreamed in Eton or Oxford days, a type that was to combine something of\\nthe real culture of the scholar with all the grace and distinction and\\nperfect manner of a citizen of the world. To them he seemed to be of\\nthe company of those whom Dante describes as having sought to “make\\nthemselves perfect by the worship of beauty.” Like Gautier, he was one\\nfor whom “the visible world existed.”\\n\\nAnd, certainly, to him life itself was the first, the greatest, of the\\narts, and for it all the other arts seemed to be but a preparation.\\nFashion, by which what is really fantastic becomes for a moment\\nuniversal, and dandyism, which, in its own way, is an attempt to assert\\nthe absolute modernity of beauty, had, of course, their fascination for\\nhim. His mode of dressing, and the particular styles that from time to\\ntime he affected, had their marked influence on the young exquisites of\\nthe Mayfair balls and Pall Mall club windows, who copied him in\\neverything that he did, and tried to reproduce the accidental charm of\\nhis graceful, though to him only half-serious, fopperies.\\n\\nFor, while he was but too ready to accept the position that was almost\\nimmediately offered to him on his coming of age, and found, indeed, a\\nsubtle pleasure in the thought that he might really become to the\\nLondon of his own day what to imperial Neronian Rome the author of the\\nSatyricon once had been, yet in his inmost heart he desired to be\\nsomething more than a mere _arbiter elegantiarum_, to be consulted on\\nthe wearing of a jewel, or the knotting of a necktie, or the conduct of\\na cane. He sought to elaborate some new scheme of life that would have\\nits reasoned philosophy and its ordered principles, and find in the\\nspiritualizing of the senses its highest realization.\\n\\nThe worship of the senses has often, and with much justice, been\\ndecried, men feeling a natural instinct of terror about passions and\\nsensations that seem stronger than themselves, and that they are\\nconscious of sharing with the less highly organized forms of existence.\\nBut it appeared to Dorian Gray that the true nature of the senses had\\nnever been understood, and that they had remained savage and animal\\nmerely because the world had sought to starve them into submission or\\nto kill them by pain, instead of aiming at making them elements of a\\nnew spirituality, of which a fine instinct for beauty was to be the\\ndominant characteristic. As he looked back upon man moving through\\nhistory, he was haunted by a feeling of loss. So much had been\\nsurrendered! and to such little purpose! There had been mad wilful\\nrejections, monstrous forms of self-torture and self-denial, whose\\norigin was fear and whose result was a degradation infinitely more\\nterrible than that fancied degradation from which, in their ignorance,\\nthey had sought to escape; Nature, in her wonderful irony, driving out\\nthe anchorite to feed with the wild animals of the desert and giving to\\nthe hermit the beasts of the field as his companions.\\n\\nYes: there was to be, as Lord Henry had prophesied, a new Hedonism that\\nwas to recreate life and to save it from that harsh uncomely puritanism\\nthat is having, in our own day, its curious revival. It was to have its\\nservice of the intellect, certainly, yet it was never to accept any\\ntheory or system that would involve the sacrifice of any mode of\\npassionate experience. Its aim, indeed, was to be experience itself,\\nand not the fruits of experience, sweet or bitter as they might be. Of\\nthe asceticism that deadens the senses, as of the vulgar profligacy\\nthat dulls them, it was to know nothing. But it was to teach man to\\nconcentrate himself upon the moments of a life that is itself but a\\nmoment.\\n\\nThere are few of us who have not sometimes wakened before dawn, either\\nafter one of those dreamless nights that make us almost enamoured of\\ndeath, or one of those nights of horror and misshapen joy, when through\\nthe chambers of the brain sweep phantoms more terrible than reality\\nitself, and instinct with that vivid life that lurks in all grotesques,\\nand that lends to Gothic art its enduring vitality, this art being, one\\nmight fancy, especially the art of those whose minds have been troubled\\nwith the malady of reverie. Gradually white fingers creep through the\\ncurtains, and they appear to tremble. In black fantastic shapes, dumb\\nshadows crawl into the corners of the room and crouch there. Outside,\\nthere is the stirring of birds among the leaves, or the sound of men\\ngoing forth to their work, or the sigh and sob of the wind coming down\\nfrom the hills and wandering round the silent house, as though it\\nfeared to wake the sleepers and yet must needs call forth sleep from\\nher purple cave. Veil after veil of thin dusky gauze is lifted, and by\\ndegrees the forms and colours of things are restored to them, and we\\nwatch the dawn remaking the world in its antique pattern. The wan\\nmirrors get back their mimic life. The flameless tapers stand where we\\nhad left them, and beside them lies the half-cut book that we had been\\nstudying, or the wired flower that we had worn at the ball, or the\\nletter that we had been afraid to read, or that we had read too often.\\nNothing seems to us changed. Out of the unreal shadows of the night\\ncomes back the real life that we had known. We have to resume it where\\nwe had left off, and there steals over us a terrible sense of the\\nnecessity for the continuance of energy in the same wearisome round of\\nstereotyped habits, or a wild longing, it may be, that our eyelids\\nmight open some morning upon a world that had been refashioned anew in\\nthe darkness for our pleasure, a world in which things would have fresh\\nshapes and colours, and be changed, or have other secrets, a world in\\nwhich the past would have little or no place, or survive, at any rate,\\nin no conscious form of obligation or regret, the remembrance even of\\njoy having its bitterness and the memories of pleasure their pain.\\n\\nIt was the creation of such worlds as these that seemed to Dorian Gray\\nto be the true object, or amongst the true objects, of life; and in his\\nsearch for sensations that would be at once new and delightful, and\\npossess that element of strangeness that is so essential to romance, he\\nwould often adopt certain modes of thought that he knew to be really\\nalien to his nature, abandon himself to their subtle influences, and\\nthen, having, as it were, caught their colour and satisfied his\\nintellectual curiosity, leave them with that curious indifference that\\nis not incompatible with a real ardour of temperament, and that,\\nindeed, according to certain modern psychologists, is often a condition\\nof it.\\n\\nIt was rumoured of him once that he was about to join the Roman\\nCatholic communion, and certainly the Roman ritual had always a great\\nattraction for him. The daily sacrifice, more awful really than all the\\nsacrifices of the antique world, stirred him as much by its superb\\nrejection of the evidence of the senses as by the primitive simplicity\\nof its elements and the eternal pathos of the human tragedy that it\\nsought to symbolize. He loved to kneel down on the cold marble pavement\\nand watch the priest, in his stiff flowered dalmatic, slowly and with\\nwhite hands moving aside the veil of the tabernacle, or raising aloft\\nthe jewelled, lantern-shaped monstrance with that pallid wafer that at\\ntimes, one would fain think, is indeed the “_panis cælestis_,” the\\nbread of angels, or, robed in the garments of the Passion of Christ,\\nbreaking the Host into the chalice and smiting his breast for his sins.\\nThe fuming censers that the grave boys, in their lace and scarlet,\\ntossed into the air like great gilt flowers had their subtle\\nfascination for him. As he passed out, he used to look with wonder at\\nthe black confessionals and long to sit in the dim shadow of one of\\nthem and listen to men and women whispering through the worn grating\\nthe true story of their lives.\\n\\nBut he never fell into the error of arresting his intellectual\\ndevelopment by any formal acceptance of creed or system, or of\\nmistaking, for a house in which to live, an inn that is but suitable\\nfor the sojourn of a night, or for a few hours of a night in which\\nthere are no stars and the moon is in travail. Mysticism, with its\\nmarvellous power of making common things strange to us, and the subtle\\nantinomianism that always seems to accompany it, moved him for a\\nseason; and for a season he inclined to the materialistic doctrines of\\nthe _Darwinismus_ movement in Germany, and found a curious pleasure in\\ntracing the thoughts and passions of men to some pearly cell in the\\nbrain, or some white nerve in the body, delighting in the conception of\\nthe absolute dependence of the spirit on certain physical conditions,\\nmorbid or healthy, normal or diseased. Yet, as has been said of him\\nbefore, no theory of life seemed to him to be of any importance\\ncompared with life itself. He felt keenly conscious of how barren all\\nintellectual speculation is when separated from action and experiment.\\nHe knew that the senses, no less than the soul, have their spiritual\\nmysteries to reveal.\\n\\nAnd so he would now study perfumes and the secrets of their\\nmanufacture, distilling heavily scented oils and burning odorous gums\\nfrom the East. He saw that there was no mood of the mind that had not\\nits counterpart in the sensuous life, and set himself to discover their\\ntrue relations, wondering what there was in frankincense that made one\\nmystical, and in ambergris that stirred one’s passions, and in violets\\nthat woke the memory of dead romances, and in musk that troubled the\\nbrain, and in champak that stained the imagination; and seeking often\\nto elaborate a real psychology of perfumes, and to estimate the several\\ninfluences of sweet-smelling roots and scented, pollen-laden flowers;\\nof aromatic balms and of dark and fragrant woods; of spikenard, that\\nsickens; of hovenia, that makes men mad; and of aloes, that are said to\\nbe able to expel melancholy from the soul.\\n\\nAt another time he devoted himself entirely to music, and in a long\\nlatticed room, with a vermilion-and-gold ceiling and walls of\\nolive-green lacquer, he used to give curious concerts in which mad\\ngipsies tore wild music from little zithers, or grave, yellow-shawled\\nTunisians plucked at the strained strings of monstrous lutes, while\\ngrinning Negroes beat monotonously upon copper drums and, crouching\\nupon scarlet mats, slim turbaned Indians blew through long pipes of\\nreed or brass and charmed—or feigned to charm—great hooded snakes and\\nhorrible horned adders. The harsh intervals and shrill discords of\\nbarbaric music stirred him at times when Schubert’s grace, and Chopin’s\\nbeautiful sorrows, and the mighty harmonies of Beethoven himself, fell\\nunheeded on his ear. He collected together from all parts of the world\\nthe strangest instruments that could be found, either in the tombs of\\ndead nations or among the few savage tribes that have survived contact\\nwith Western civilizations, and loved to touch and try them. He had the\\nmysterious _juruparis_ of the Rio Negro Indians, that women are not\\nallowed to look at and that even youths may not see till they have been\\nsubjected to fasting and scourging, and the earthen jars of the\\nPeruvians that have the shrill cries of birds, and flutes of human\\nbones such as Alfonso de Ovalle heard in Chile, and the sonorous green\\njaspers that are found near Cuzco and give forth a note of singular\\nsweetness. He had painted gourds filled with pebbles that rattled when\\nthey were shaken; the long _clarin_ of the Mexicans, into which the\\nperformer does not blow, but through which he inhales the air; the\\nharsh _ture_ of the Amazon tribes, that is sounded by the sentinels who\\nsit all day long in high trees, and can be heard, it is said, at a\\ndistance of three leagues; the _teponaztli_, that has two vibrating\\ntongues of wood and is beaten with sticks that are smeared with an\\nelastic gum obtained from the milky juice of plants; the _yotl_-bells\\nof the Aztecs, that are hung in clusters like grapes; and a huge\\ncylindrical drum, covered with the skins of great serpents, like the\\none that Bernal Diaz saw when he went with Cortes into the Mexican\\ntemple, and of whose doleful sound he has left us so vivid a\\ndescription. The fantastic character of these instruments fascinated\\nhim, and he felt a curious delight in the thought that art, like\\nNature, has her monsters, things of bestial shape and with hideous\\nvoices. Yet, after some time, he wearied of them, and would sit in his\\nbox at the opera, either alone or with Lord Henry, listening in rapt\\npleasure to “Tannhauser” and seeing in the prelude to that great work\\nof art a presentation of the tragedy of his own soul.\\n\\nOn one occasion he took up the study of jewels, and appeared at a\\ncostume ball as Anne de Joyeuse, Admiral of France, in a dress covered\\nwith five hundred and sixty pearls. This taste enthralled him for\\nyears, and, indeed, may be said never to have left him. He would often\\nspend a whole day settling and resettling in their cases the various\\nstones that he had collected, such as the olive-green chrysoberyl that\\nturns red by lamplight, the cymophane with its wirelike line of silver,\\nthe pistachio-coloured peridot, rose-pink and wine-yellow topazes,\\ncarbuncles of fiery scarlet with tremulous, four-rayed stars, flame-red\\ncinnamon-stones, orange and violet spinels, and amethysts with their\\nalternate layers of ruby and sapphire. He loved the red gold of the\\nsunstone, and the moonstone’s pearly whiteness, and the broken rainbow\\nof the milky opal. He procured from Amsterdam three emeralds of\\nextraordinary size and richness of colour, and had a turquoise _de la\\nvieille roche_ that was the envy of all the connoisseurs.\\n\\nHe discovered wonderful stories, also, about jewels. In Alphonso’s\\nClericalis Disciplina a serpent was mentioned with eyes of real\\njacinth, and in the romantic history of Alexander, the Conqueror of\\nEmathia was said to have found in the vale of Jordan snakes “with\\ncollars of real emeralds growing on their backs.” There was a gem in\\nthe brain of the dragon, Philostratus told us, and “by the exhibition\\nof golden letters and a scarlet robe” the monster could be thrown into\\na magical sleep and slain. According to the great alchemist, Pierre de\\nBoniface, the diamond rendered a man invisible, and the agate of India\\nmade him eloquent. The cornelian appeased anger, and the hyacinth\\nprovoked sleep, and the amethyst drove away the fumes of wine. The\\ngarnet cast out demons, and the hydropicus deprived the moon of her\\ncolour. The selenite waxed and waned with the moon, and the meloceus,\\nthat discovers thieves, could be affected only by the blood of kids.\\nLeonardus Camillus had seen a white stone taken from the brain of a\\nnewly killed toad, that was a certain antidote against poison. The\\nbezoar, that was found in the heart of the Arabian deer, was a charm\\nthat could cure the plague. In the nests of Arabian birds was the\\naspilates, that, according to Democritus, kept the wearer from any\\ndanger by fire.\\n\\nThe King of Ceilan rode through his city with a large ruby in his hand,\\nas the ceremony of his coronation. The gates of the palace of John the\\nPriest were “made of sardius, with the horn of the horned snake\\ninwrought, so that no man might bring poison within.” Over the gable\\nwere “two golden apples, in which were two carbuncles,” so that the\\ngold might shine by day and the carbuncles by night. In Lodge’s strange\\nromance ‘A Margarite of America’, it was stated that in the chamber of\\nthe queen one could behold “all the chaste ladies of the world,\\ninchased out of silver, looking through fair mirrours of chrysolites,\\ncarbuncles, sapphires, and greene emeraults.” Marco Polo had seen the\\ninhabitants of Zipangu place rose-coloured pearls in the mouths of the\\ndead. A sea-monster had been enamoured of the pearl that the diver\\nbrought to King Perozes, and had slain the thief, and mourned for seven\\nmoons over its loss. When the Huns lured the king into the great pit,\\nhe flung it away—Procopius tells the story—nor was it ever found again,\\nthough the Emperor Anastasius offered five hundred-weight of gold\\npieces for it. The King of Malabar had shown to a certain Venetian a\\nrosary of three hundred and four pearls, one for every god that he\\nworshipped.\\n\\nWhen the Duke de Valentinois, son of Alexander VI., visited Louis XII.\\nof France, his horse was loaded with gold leaves, according to\\nBrantome, and his cap had double rows of rubies that threw out a great\\nlight. Charles of England had ridden in stirrups hung with four hundred\\nand twenty-one diamonds. Richard II had a coat, valued at thirty\\nthousand marks, which was covered with balas rubies. Hall described\\nHenry VIII., on his way to the Tower previous to his coronation, as\\nwearing “a jacket of raised gold, the placard embroidered with diamonds\\nand other rich stones, and a great bauderike about his neck of large\\nbalasses.” The favourites of James I wore ear-rings of emeralds set in\\ngold filigrane. Edward II gave to Piers Gaveston a suit of red-gold\\narmour studded with jacinths, a collar of gold roses set with\\nturquoise-stones, and a skull-cap _parsemé_ with pearls. Henry II. wore\\njewelled gloves reaching to the elbow, and had a hawk-glove sewn with\\ntwelve rubies and fifty-two great orients. The ducal hat of Charles the\\nRash, the last Duke of Burgundy of his race, was hung with pear-shaped\\npearls and studded with sapphires.\\n\\nHow exquisite life had once been! How gorgeous in its pomp and\\ndecoration! Even to read of the luxury of the dead was wonderful.\\n\\nThen he turned his attention to embroideries and to the tapestries that\\nperformed the office of frescoes in the chill rooms of the northern\\nnations of Europe. As he investigated the subject—and he always had an\\nextraordinary faculty of becoming absolutely absorbed for the moment in\\nwhatever he took up—he was almost saddened by the reflection of the\\nruin that time brought on beautiful and wonderful things. He, at any\\nrate, had escaped that. Summer followed summer, and the yellow jonquils\\nbloomed and died many times, and nights of horror repeated the story of\\ntheir shame, but he was unchanged. No winter marred his face or stained\\nhis flowerlike bloom. How different it was with material things! Where\\nhad they passed to? Where was the great crocus-coloured robe, on which\\nthe gods fought against the giants, that had been worked by brown girls\\nfor the pleasure of Athena? Where the huge velarium that Nero had\\nstretched across the Colosseum at Rome, that Titan sail of purple on\\nwhich was represented the starry sky, and Apollo driving a chariot\\ndrawn by white, gilt-reined steeds? He longed to see the curious\\ntable-napkins wrought for the Priest of the Sun, on which were\\ndisplayed all the dainties and viands that could be wanted for a feast;\\nthe mortuary cloth of King Chilperic, with its three hundred golden\\nbees; the fantastic robes that excited the indignation of the Bishop of\\nPontus and were figured with “lions, panthers, bears, dogs, forests,\\nrocks, hunters—all, in fact, that a painter can copy from nature”; and\\nthe coat that Charles of Orleans once wore, on the sleeves of which\\nwere embroidered the verses of a song beginning “_Madame, je suis tout\\njoyeux_,” the musical accompaniment of the words being wrought in gold\\nthread, and each note, of square shape in those days, formed with four\\npearls. He read of the room that was prepared at the palace at Rheims\\nfor the use of Queen Joan of Burgundy and was decorated with “thirteen\\nhundred and twenty-one parrots, made in broidery, and blazoned with the\\nking’s arms, and five hundred and sixty-one butterflies, whose wings\\nwere similarly ornamented with the arms of the queen, the whole worked\\nin gold.” Catherine de Medicis had a mourning-bed made for her of black\\nvelvet powdered with crescents and suns. Its curtains were of damask,\\nwith leafy wreaths and garlands, figured upon a gold and silver ground,\\nand fringed along the edges with broideries of pearls, and it stood in\\na room hung with rows of the queen’s devices in cut black velvet upon\\ncloth of silver. Louis XIV. had gold embroidered caryatides fifteen\\nfeet high in his apartment. The state bed of Sobieski, King of Poland,\\nwas made of Smyrna gold brocade embroidered in turquoises with verses\\nfrom the Koran. Its supports were of silver gilt, beautifully chased,\\nand profusely set with enamelled and jewelled medallions. It had been\\ntaken from the Turkish camp before Vienna, and the standard of Mohammed\\nhad stood beneath the tremulous gilt of its canopy.\\n\\nAnd so, for a whole year, he sought to accumulate the most exquisite\\nspecimens that he could find of textile and embroidered work, getting\\nthe dainty Delhi muslins, finely wrought with gold-thread palmates and\\nstitched over with iridescent beetles’ wings; the Dacca gauzes, that\\nfrom their transparency are known in the East as “woven air,” and\\n“running water,” and “evening dew”; strange figured cloths from Java;\\nelaborate yellow Chinese hangings; books bound in tawny satins or fair\\nblue silks and wrought with _fleurs-de-lis_, birds and images; veils of\\n_lacis_ worked in Hungary point; Sicilian brocades and stiff Spanish\\nvelvets; Georgian work, with its gilt coins, and Japanese _Foukousas_,\\nwith their green-toned golds and their marvellously plumaged birds.\\n\\nHe had a special passion, also, for ecclesiastical vestments, as indeed\\nhe had for everything connected with the service of the Church. In the\\nlong cedar chests that lined the west gallery of his house, he had\\nstored away many rare and beautiful specimens of what is really the\\nraiment of the Bride of Christ, who must wear purple and jewels and\\nfine linen that she may hide the pallid macerated body that is worn by\\nthe suffering that she seeks for and wounded by self-inflicted pain. He\\npossessed a gorgeous cope of crimson silk and gold-thread damask,\\nfigured with a repeating pattern of golden pomegranates set in\\nsix-petalled formal blossoms, beyond which on either side was the\\npine-apple device wrought in seed-pearls. The orphreys were divided\\ninto panels representing scenes from the life of the Virgin, and the\\ncoronation of the Virgin was figured in coloured silks upon the hood.\\nThis was Italian work of the fifteenth century. Another cope was of\\ngreen velvet, embroidered with heart-shaped groups of acanthus-leaves,\\nfrom which spread long-stemmed white blossoms, the details of which\\nwere picked out with silver thread and coloured crystals. The morse\\nbore a seraph’s head in gold-thread raised work. The orphreys were\\nwoven in a diaper of red and gold silk, and were starred with\\nmedallions of many saints and martyrs, among whom was St. Sebastian. He\\nhad chasubles, also, of amber-coloured silk, and blue silk and gold\\nbrocade, and yellow silk damask and cloth of gold, figured with\\nrepresentations of the Passion and Crucifixion of Christ, and\\nembroidered with lions and peacocks and other emblems; dalmatics of\\nwhite satin and pink silk damask, decorated with tulips and dolphins\\nand _fleurs-de-lis_; altar frontals of crimson velvet and blue linen;\\nand many corporals, chalice-veils, and sudaria. In the mystic offices\\nto which such things were put, there was something that quickened his\\nimagination.\\n\\nFor these treasures, and everything that he collected in his lovely\\nhouse, were to be to him means of forgetfulness, modes by which he\\ncould escape, for a season, from the fear that seemed to him at times\\nto be almost too great to be borne. Upon the walls of the lonely locked\\nroom where he had spent so much of his boyhood, he had hung with his\\nown hands the terrible portrait whose changing features showed him the\\nreal degradation of his life, and in front of it had draped the\\npurple-and-gold pall as a curtain. For weeks he would not go there,\\nwould forget the hideous painted thing, and get back his light heart,\\nhis wonderful joyousness, his passionate absorption in mere existence.\\nThen, suddenly, some night he would creep out of the house, go down to\\ndreadful places near Blue Gate Fields, and stay there, day after day,\\nuntil he was driven away. On his return he would sit in front of the\\npicture, sometimes loathing it and himself, but filled, at other times,\\nwith that pride of individualism that is half the fascination of sin,\\nand smiling with secret pleasure at the misshapen shadow that had to\\nbear the burden that should have been his own.\\n\\nAfter a few years he could not endure to be long out of England, and\\ngave up the villa that he had shared at Trouville with Lord Henry, as\\nwell as the little white walled-in house at Algiers where they had more\\nthan once spent the winter. He hated to be separated from the picture\\nthat was such a part of his life, and was also afraid that during his\\nabsence some one might gain access to the room, in spite of the\\nelaborate bars that he had caused to be placed upon the door.\\n\\nHe was quite conscious that this would tell them nothing. It was true\\nthat the portrait still preserved, under all the foulness and ugliness\\nof the face, its marked likeness to himself; but what could they learn\\nfrom that? He would laugh at any one who tried to taunt him. He had not\\npainted it. What was it to him how vile and full of shame it looked?\\nEven if he told them, would they believe it?\\n\\nYet he was afraid. Sometimes when he was down at his great house in\\nNottinghamshire, entertaining the fashionable young men of his own rank\\nwho were his chief companions, and astounding the county by the wanton\\nluxury and gorgeous splendour of his mode of life, he would suddenly\\nleave his guests and rush back to town to see that the door had not\\nbeen tampered with and that the picture was still there. What if it\\nshould be stolen? The mere thought made him cold with horror. Surely\\nthe world would know his secret then. Perhaps the world already\\nsuspected it.\\n\\nFor, while he fascinated many, there were not a few who distrusted him.\\nHe was very nearly blackballed at a West End club of which his birth\\nand social position fully entitled him to become a member, and it was\\nsaid that on one occasion, when he was brought by a friend into the\\nsmoking-room of the Churchill, the Duke of Berwick and another\\ngentleman got up in a marked manner and went out. Curious stories\\nbecame current about him after he had passed his twenty-fifth year. It\\nwas rumoured that he had been seen brawling with foreign sailors in a\\nlow den in the distant parts of Whitechapel, and that he consorted with\\nthieves and coiners and knew the mysteries of their trade. His\\nextraordinary absences became notorious, and, when he used to reappear\\nagain in society, men would whisper to each other in corners, or pass\\nhim with a sneer, or look at him with cold searching eyes, as though\\nthey were determined to discover his secret.\\n\\nOf such insolences and attempted slights he, of course, took no notice,\\nand in the opinion of most people his frank debonair manner, his\\ncharming boyish smile, and the infinite grace of that wonderful youth\\nthat seemed never to leave him, were in themselves a sufficient answer\\nto the calumnies, for so they termed them, that were circulated about\\nhim. It was remarked, however, that some of those who had been most\\nintimate with him appeared, after a time, to shun him. Women who had\\nwildly adored him, and for his sake had braved all social censure and\\nset convention at defiance, were seen to grow pallid with shame or\\nhorror if Dorian Gray entered the room.\\n\\nYet these whispered scandals only increased in the eyes of many his\\nstrange and dangerous charm. His great wealth was a certain element of\\nsecurity. Society—civilized society, at least—is never very ready to\\nbelieve anything to the detriment of those who are both rich and\\nfascinating. It feels instinctively that manners are of more importance\\nthan morals, and, in its opinion, the highest respectability is of much\\nless value than the possession of a good _chef_. And, after all, it is\\na very poor consolation to be told that the man who has given one a bad\\ndinner, or poor wine, is irreproachable in his private life. Even the\\ncardinal virtues cannot atone for half-cold _entrées_, as Lord Henry\\nremarked once, in a discussion on the subject, and there is possibly a\\ngood deal to be said for his view. For the canons of good society are,\\nor should be, the same as the canons of art. Form is absolutely\\nessential to it. It should have the dignity of a ceremony, as well as\\nits unreality, and should combine the insincere character of a romantic\\nplay with the wit and beauty that make such plays delightful to us. Is\\ninsincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a method\\nby which we can multiply our personalities.\\n\\nSuch, at any rate, was Dorian Gray’s opinion. He used to wonder at the\\nshallow psychology of those who conceive the ego in man as a thing\\nsimple, permanent, reliable, and of one essence. To him, man was a\\nbeing with myriad lives and myriad sensations, a complex multiform\\ncreature that bore within itself strange legacies of thought and\\npassion, and whose very flesh was tainted with the monstrous maladies\\nof the dead. He loved to stroll through the gaunt cold picture-gallery\\nof his country house and look at the various portraits of those whose\\nblood flowed in his veins. Here was Philip Herbert, described by\\nFrancis Osborne, in his Memoires on the Reigns of Queen Elizabeth and\\nKing James, as one who was “caressed by the Court for his handsome\\nface, which kept him not long company.” Was it young Herbert’s life\\nthat he sometimes led? Had some strange poisonous germ crept from body\\nto body till it had reached his own? Was it some dim sense of that\\nruined grace that had made him so suddenly, and almost without cause,\\ngive utterance, in Basil Hallward’s studio, to the mad prayer that had\\nso changed his life? Here, in gold-embroidered red doublet, jewelled\\nsurcoat, and gilt-edged ruff and wristbands, stood Sir Anthony Sherard,\\nwith his silver-and-black armour piled at his feet. What had this man’s\\nlegacy been? Had the lover of Giovanna of Naples bequeathed him some\\ninheritance of sin and shame? Were his own actions merely the dreams\\nthat the dead man had not dared to realize? Here, from the fading\\ncanvas, smiled Lady Elizabeth Devereux, in her gauze hood, pearl\\nstomacher, and pink slashed sleeves. A flower was in her right hand,\\nand her left clasped an enamelled collar of white and damask roses. On\\na table by her side lay a mandolin and an apple. There were large green\\nrosettes upon her little pointed shoes. He knew her life, and the\\nstrange stories that were told about her lovers. Had he something of\\nher temperament in him? These oval, heavy-lidded eyes seemed to look\\ncuriously at him. What of George Willoughby, with his powdered hair and\\nfantastic patches? How evil he looked! The face was saturnine and\\nswarthy, and the sensual lips seemed to be twisted with disdain.\\nDelicate lace ruffles fell over the lean yellow hands that were so\\noverladen with rings. He had been a macaroni of the eighteenth century,\\nand the friend, in his youth, of Lord Ferrars. What of the second Lord\\nBeckenham, the companion of the Prince Regent in his wildest days, and\\none of the witnesses at the secret marriage with Mrs. Fitzherbert? How\\nproud and handsome he was, with his chestnut curls and insolent pose!\\nWhat passions had he bequeathed? The world had looked upon him as\\ninfamous. He had led the orgies at Carlton House. The star of the\\nGarter glittered upon his breast. Beside him hung the portrait of his\\nwife, a pallid, thin-lipped woman in black. Her blood, also, stirred\\nwithin him. How curious it all seemed! And his mother with her Lady\\nHamilton face and her moist, wine-dashed lips—he knew what he had got\\nfrom her. He had got from her his beauty, and his passion for the\\nbeauty of others. She laughed at him in her loose Bacchante dress.\\nThere were vine leaves in her hair. The purple spilled from the cup she\\nwas holding. The carnations of the painting had withered, but the eyes\\nwere still wonderful in their depth and brilliancy of colour. They\\nseemed to follow him wherever he went.\\n\\nYet one had ancestors in literature as well as in one’s own race,\\nnearer perhaps in type and temperament, many of them, and certainly\\nwith an influence of which one was more absolutely conscious. There\\nwere times when it appeared to Dorian Gray that the whole of history\\nwas merely the record of his own life, not as he had lived it in act\\nand circumstance, but as his imagination had created it for him, as it\\nhad been in his brain and in his passions. He felt that he had known\\nthem all, those strange terrible figures that had passed across the\\nstage of the world and made sin so marvellous and evil so full of\\nsubtlety. It seemed to him that in some mysterious way their lives had\\nbeen his own.\\n\\nThe hero of the wonderful novel that had so influenced his life had\\nhimself known this curious fancy. In the seventh chapter he tells how,\\ncrowned with laurel, lest lightning might strike him, he had sat, as\\nTiberius, in a garden at Capri, reading the shameful books of\\nElephantis, while dwarfs and peacocks strutted round him and the\\nflute-player mocked the swinger of the censer; and, as Caligula, had\\ncaroused with the green-shirted jockeys in their stables and supped in\\nan ivory manger with a jewel-frontleted horse; and, as Domitian, had\\nwandered through a corridor lined with marble mirrors, looking round\\nwith haggard eyes for the reflection of the dagger that was to end his\\ndays, and sick with that ennui, that terrible _tædium vitæ_, that comes\\non those to whom life denies nothing; and had peered through a clear\\nemerald at the red shambles of the circus and then, in a litter of\\npearl and purple drawn by silver-shod mules, been carried through the\\nStreet of Pomegranates to a House of Gold and heard men cry on Nero\\nCaesar as he passed by; and, as Elagabalus, had painted his face with\\ncolours, and plied the distaff among the women, and brought the Moon\\nfrom Carthage and given her in mystic marriage to the Sun.\\n\\nOver and over again Dorian used to read this fantastic chapter, and the\\ntwo chapters immediately following, in which, as in some curious\\ntapestries or cunningly wrought enamels, were pictured the awful and\\nbeautiful forms of those whom vice and blood and weariness had made\\nmonstrous or mad: Filippo, Duke of Milan, who slew his wife and painted\\nher lips with a scarlet poison that her lover might suck death from the\\ndead thing he fondled; Pietro Barbi, the Venetian, known as Paul the\\nSecond, who sought in his vanity to assume the title of Formosus, and\\nwhose tiara, valued at two hundred thousand florins, was bought at the\\nprice of a terrible sin; Gian Maria Visconti, who used hounds to chase\\nliving men and whose murdered body was covered with roses by a harlot\\nwho had loved him; the Borgia on his white horse, with Fratricide\\nriding beside him and his mantle stained with the blood of Perotto;\\nPietro Riario, the young Cardinal Archbishop of Florence, child and\\nminion of Sixtus IV., whose beauty was equalled only by his debauchery,\\nand who received Leonora of Aragon in a pavilion of white and crimson\\nsilk, filled with nymphs and centaurs, and gilded a boy that he might\\nserve at the feast as Ganymede or Hylas; Ezzelin, whose melancholy\\ncould be cured only by the spectacle of death, and who had a passion\\nfor red blood, as other men have for red wine—the son of the Fiend, as\\nwas reported, and one who had cheated his father at dice when gambling\\nwith him for his own soul; Giambattista Cibo, who in mockery took the\\nname of Innocent and into whose torpid veins the blood of three lads\\nwas infused by a Jewish doctor; Sigismondo Malatesta, the lover of\\nIsotta and the lord of Rimini, whose effigy was burned at Rome as the\\nenemy of God and man, who strangled Polyssena with a napkin, and gave\\npoison to Ginevra d’Este in a cup of emerald, and in honour of a\\nshameful passion built a pagan church for Christian worship; Charles\\nVI., who had so wildly adored his brother’s wife that a leper had\\nwarned him of the insanity that was coming on him, and who, when his\\nbrain had sickened and grown strange, could only be soothed by Saracen\\ncards painted with the images of love and death and madness; and, in\\nhis trimmed jerkin and jewelled cap and acanthuslike curls, Grifonetto\\nBaglioni, who slew Astorre with his bride, and Simonetto with his page,\\nand whose comeliness was such that, as he lay dying in the yellow\\npiazza of Perugia, those who had hated him could not choose but weep,\\nand Atalanta, who had cursed him, blessed him.\\n\\nThere was a horrible fascination in them all. He saw them at night, and\\nthey troubled his imagination in the day. The Renaissance knew of\\nstrange manners of poisoning—poisoning by a helmet and a lighted torch,\\nby an embroidered glove and a jewelled fan, by a gilded pomander and by\\nan amber chain. Dorian Gray had been poisoned by a book. There were\\nmoments when he looked on evil simply as a mode through which he could\\nrealize his conception of the beautiful.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII\\n\\n\\nIt was on the ninth of November, the eve of his own thirty-eighth\\nbirthday, as he often remembered afterwards.\\n\\nHe was walking home about eleven o’clock from Lord Henry’s, where he\\nhad been dining, and was wrapped in heavy furs, as the night was cold\\nand foggy. At the corner of Grosvenor Square and South Audley Street, a\\nman passed him in the mist, walking very fast and with the collar of\\nhis grey ulster turned up. He had a bag in his hand. Dorian recognized\\nhim. It was Basil Hallward. A strange sense of fear, for which he could\\nnot account, came over him. He made no sign of recognition and went on\\nquickly in the direction of his own house.\\n\\nBut Hallward had seen him. Dorian heard him first stopping on the\\npavement and then hurrying after him. In a few moments, his hand was on\\nhis arm.\\n\\n“Dorian! What an extraordinary piece of luck! I have been waiting for\\nyou in your library ever since nine o’clock. Finally I took pity on\\nyour tired servant and told him to go to bed, as he let me out. I am\\noff to Paris by the midnight train, and I particularly wanted to see\\nyou before I left. I thought it was you, or rather your fur coat, as\\nyou passed me. But I wasn’t quite sure. Didn’t you recognize me?”\\n\\n“In this fog, my dear Basil? Why, I can’t even recognize Grosvenor\\nSquare. I believe my house is somewhere about here, but I don’t feel at\\nall certain about it. I am sorry you are going away, as I have not seen\\nyou for ages. But I suppose you will be back soon?”\\n\\n“No: I am going to be out of England for six months. I intend to take a\\nstudio in Paris and shut myself up till I have finished a great picture\\nI have in my head. However, it wasn’t about myself I wanted to talk.\\nHere we are at your door. Let me come in for a moment. I have something\\nto say to you.”\\n\\n“I shall be charmed. But won’t you miss your train?” said Dorian Gray\\nlanguidly as he passed up the steps and opened the door with his\\nlatch-key.\\n\\nThe lamplight struggled out through the fog, and Hallward looked at his\\nwatch. “I have heaps of time,” he answered. “The train doesn’t go till\\ntwelve-fifteen, and it is only just eleven. In fact, I was on my way to\\nthe club to look for you, when I met you. You see, I shan’t have any\\ndelay about luggage, as I have sent on my heavy things. All I have with\\nme is in this bag, and I can easily get to Victoria in twenty minutes.”\\n\\nDorian looked at him and smiled. “What a way for a fashionable painter\\nto travel! A Gladstone bag and an ulster! Come in, or the fog will get\\ninto the house. And mind you don’t talk about anything serious. Nothing\\nis serious nowadays. At least nothing should be.”\\n\\nHallward shook his head, as he entered, and followed Dorian into the\\nlibrary. There was a bright wood fire blazing in the large open hearth.\\nThe lamps were lit, and an open Dutch silver spirit-case stood, with\\nsome siphons of soda-water and large cut-glass tumblers, on a little\\nmarqueterie table.\\n\\n“You see your servant made me quite at home, Dorian. He gave me\\neverything I wanted, including your best gold-tipped cigarettes. He is\\na most hospitable creature. I like him much better than the Frenchman\\nyou used to have. What has become of the Frenchman, by the bye?”\\n\\nDorian shrugged his shoulders. “I believe he married Lady Radley’s\\nmaid, and has established her in Paris as an English dressmaker.\\n_Anglomanie_ is very fashionable over there now, I hear. It seems silly\\nof the French, doesn’t it? But—do you know?—he was not at all a bad\\nservant. I never liked him, but I had nothing to complain about. One\\noften imagines things that are quite absurd. He was really very devoted\\nto me and seemed quite sorry when he went away. Have another\\nbrandy-and-soda? Or would you like hock-and-seltzer? I always take\\nhock-and-seltzer myself. There is sure to be some in the next room.”\\n\\n“Thanks, I won’t have anything more,” said the painter, taking his cap\\nand coat off and throwing them on the bag that he had placed in the\\ncorner. “And now, my dear fellow, I want to speak to you seriously.\\nDon’t frown like that. You make it so much more difficult for me.”\\n\\n“What is it all about?” cried Dorian in his petulant way, flinging\\nhimself down on the sofa. “I hope it is not about myself. I am tired of\\nmyself to-night. I should like to be somebody else.”\\n\\n“It is about yourself,” answered Hallward in his grave deep voice, “and\\nI must say it to you. I shall only keep you half an hour.”\\n\\nDorian sighed and lit a cigarette. “Half an hour!” he murmured.\\n\\n“It is not much to ask of you, Dorian, and it is entirely for your own\\nsake that I am speaking. I think it right that you should know that the\\nmost dreadful things are being said against you in London.”\\n\\n“I don’t wish to know anything about them. I love scandals about other\\npeople, but scandals about myself don’t interest me. They have not got\\nthe charm of novelty.”\\n\\n“They must interest you, Dorian. Every gentleman is interested in his\\ngood name. You don’t want people to talk of you as something vile and\\ndegraded. Of course, you have your position, and your wealth, and all\\nthat kind of thing. But position and wealth are not everything. Mind\\nyou, I don’t believe these rumours at all. At least, I can’t believe\\nthem when I see you. Sin is a thing that writes itself across a man’s\\nface. It cannot be concealed. People talk sometimes of secret vices.\\nThere are no such things. If a wretched man has a vice, it shows itself\\nin the lines of his mouth, the droop of his eyelids, the moulding of\\nhis hands even. Somebody—I won’t mention his name, but you know\\nhim—came to me last year to have his portrait done. I had never seen\\nhim before, and had never heard anything about him at the time, though\\nI have heard a good deal since. He offered an extravagant price. I\\nrefused him. There was something in the shape of his fingers that I\\nhated. I know now that I was quite right in what I fancied about him.\\nHis life is dreadful. But you, Dorian, with your pure, bright, innocent\\nface, and your marvellous untroubled youth—I can’t believe anything\\nagainst you. And yet I see you very seldom, and you never come down to\\nthe studio now, and when I am away from you, and I hear all these\\nhideous things that people are whispering about you, I don’t know what\\nto say. Why is it, Dorian, that a man like the Duke of Berwick leaves\\nthe room of a club when you enter it? Why is it that so many gentlemen\\nin London will neither go to your house or invite you to theirs? You\\nused to be a friend of Lord Staveley. I met him at dinner last week.\\nYour name happened to come up in conversation, in connection with the\\nminiatures you have lent to the exhibition at the Dudley. Staveley\\ncurled his lip and said that you might have the most artistic tastes,\\nbut that you were a man whom no pure-minded girl should be allowed to\\nknow, and whom no chaste woman should sit in the same room with. I\\nreminded him that I was a friend of yours, and asked him what he meant.\\nHe told me. He told me right out before everybody. It was horrible! Why\\nis your friendship so fatal to young men? There was that wretched boy\\nin the Guards who committed suicide. You were his great friend. There\\nwas Sir Henry Ashton, who had to leave England with a tarnished name.\\nYou and he were inseparable. What about Adrian Singleton and his\\ndreadful end? What about Lord Kent’s only son and his career? I met his\\nfather yesterday in St. James’s Street. He seemed broken with shame and\\nsorrow. What about the young Duke of Perth? What sort of life has he\\ngot now? What gentleman would associate with him?”\\n\\n“Stop, Basil. You are talking about things of which you know nothing,”\\nsaid Dorian Gray, biting his lip, and with a note of infinite contempt\\nin his voice. “You ask me why Berwick leaves a room when I enter it. It\\nis because I know everything about his life, not because he knows\\nanything about mine. With such blood as he has in his veins, how could\\nhis record be clean? You ask me about Henry Ashton and young Perth. Did\\nI teach the one his vices, and the other his debauchery? If Kent’s\\nsilly son takes his wife from the streets, what is that to me? If\\nAdrian Singleton writes his friend’s name across a bill, am I his\\nkeeper? I know how people chatter in England. The middle classes air\\ntheir moral prejudices over their gross dinner-tables, and whisper\\nabout what they call the profligacies of their betters in order to try\\nand pretend that they are in smart society and on intimate terms with\\nthe people they slander. In this country, it is enough for a man to\\nhave distinction and brains for every common tongue to wag against him.\\nAnd what sort of lives do these people, who pose as being moral, lead\\nthemselves? My dear fellow, you forget that we are in the native land\\nof the hypocrite.”\\n\\n“Dorian,” cried Hallward, “that is not the question. England is bad\\nenough I know, and English society is all wrong. That is the reason why\\nI want you to be fine. You have not been fine. One has a right to judge\\nof a man by the effect he has over his friends. Yours seem to lose all\\nsense of honour, of goodness, of purity. You have filled them with a\\nmadness for pleasure. They have gone down into the depths. You led them\\nthere. Yes: you led them there, and yet you can smile, as you are\\nsmiling now. And there is worse behind. I know you and Harry are\\ninseparable. Surely for that reason, if for none other, you should not\\nhave made his sister’s name a by-word.”\\n\\n“Take care, Basil. You go too far.”\\n\\n“I must speak, and you must listen. You shall listen. When you met Lady\\nGwendolen, not a breath of scandal had ever touched her. Is there a\\nsingle decent woman in London now who would drive with her in the park?\\nWhy, even her children are not allowed to live with her. Then there are\\nother stories—stories that you have been seen creeping at dawn out of\\ndreadful houses and slinking in disguise into the foulest dens in\\nLondon. Are they true? Can they be true? When I first heard them, I\\nlaughed. I hear them now, and they make me shudder. What about your\\ncountry-house and the life that is led there? Dorian, you don’t know\\nwhat is said about you. I won’t tell you that I don’t want to preach to\\nyou. I remember Harry saying once that every man who turned himself\\ninto an amateur curate for the moment always began by saying that, and\\nthen proceeded to break his word. I do want to preach to you. I want\\nyou to lead such a life as will make the world respect you. I want you\\nto have a clean name and a fair record. I want you to get rid of the\\ndreadful people you associate with. Don’t shrug your shoulders like\\nthat. Don’t be so indifferent. You have a wonderful influence. Let it\\nbe for good, not for evil. They say that you corrupt every one with\\nwhom you become intimate, and that it is quite sufficient for you to\\nenter a house for shame of some kind to follow after. I don’t know\\nwhether it is so or not. How should I know? But it is said of you. I am\\ntold things that it seems impossible to doubt. Lord Gloucester was one\\nof my greatest friends at Oxford. He showed me a letter that his wife\\nhad written to him when she was dying alone in her villa at Mentone.\\nYour name was implicated in the most terrible confession I ever read. I\\ntold him that it was absurd—that I knew you thoroughly and that you\\nwere incapable of anything of the kind. Know you? I wonder do I know\\nyou? Before I could answer that, I should have to see your soul.”\\n\\n“To see my soul!” muttered Dorian Gray, starting up from the sofa and\\nturning almost white from fear.\\n\\n“Yes,” answered Hallward gravely, and with deep-toned sorrow in his\\nvoice, “to see your soul. But only God can do that.”\\n\\nA bitter laugh of mockery broke from the lips of the younger man. “You\\nshall see it yourself, to-night!” he cried, seizing a lamp from the\\ntable. “Come: it is your own handiwork. Why shouldn’t you look at it?\\nYou can tell the world all about it afterwards, if you choose. Nobody\\nwould believe you. If they did believe you, they would like me all the\\nbetter for it. I know the age better than you do, though you will prate\\nabout it so tediously. Come, I tell you. You have chattered enough\\nabout corruption. Now you shall look on it face to face.”\\n\\nThere was the madness of pride in every word he uttered. He stamped his\\nfoot upon the ground in his boyish insolent manner. He felt a terrible\\njoy at the thought that some one else was to share his secret, and that\\nthe man who had painted the portrait that was the origin of all his\\nshame was to be burdened for the rest of his life with the hideous\\nmemory of what he had done.\\n\\n“Yes,” he continued, coming closer to him and looking steadfastly into\\nhis stern eyes, “I shall show you my soul. You shall see the thing that\\nyou fancy only God can see.”\\n\\nHallward started back. “This is blasphemy, Dorian!” he cried. “You must\\nnot say things like that. They are horrible, and they don’t mean\\nanything.”\\n\\n“You think so?” He laughed again.\\n\\n“I know so. As for what I said to you to-night, I said it for your\\ngood. You know I have been always a stanch friend to you.”\\n\\n“Don’t touch me. Finish what you have to say.”\\n\\nA twisted flash of pain shot across the painter’s face. He paused for a\\nmoment, and a wild feeling of pity came over him. After all, what right\\nhad he to pry into the life of Dorian Gray? If he had done a tithe of\\nwhat was rumoured about him, how much he must have suffered! Then he\\nstraightened himself up, and walked over to the fire-place, and stood\\nthere, looking at the burning logs with their frostlike ashes and their\\nthrobbing cores of flame.\\n\\n“I am waiting, Basil,” said the young man in a hard clear voice.\\n\\nHe turned round. “What I have to say is this,” he cried. “You must give\\nme some answer to these horrible charges that are made against you. If\\nyou tell me that they are absolutely untrue from beginning to end, I\\nshall believe you. Deny them, Dorian, deny them! Can’t you see what I\\nam going through? My God! don’t tell me that you are bad, and corrupt,\\nand shameful.”\\n\\nDorian Gray smiled. There was a curl of contempt in his lips. “Come\\nupstairs, Basil,” he said quietly. “I keep a diary of my life from day\\nto day, and it never leaves the room in which it is written. I shall\\nshow it to you if you come with me.”\\n\\n“I shall come with you, Dorian, if you wish it. I see I have missed my\\ntrain. That makes no matter. I can go to-morrow. But don’t ask me to\\nread anything to-night. All I want is a plain answer to my question.”\\n\\n“That shall be given to you upstairs. I could not give it here. You\\nwill not have to read long.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII.\\n\\n\\nHe passed out of the room and began the ascent, Basil Hallward\\nfollowing close behind. They walked softly, as men do instinctively at\\nnight. The lamp cast fantastic shadows on the wall and staircase. A\\nrising wind made some of the windows rattle.\\n\\nWhen they reached the top landing, Dorian set the lamp down on the\\nfloor, and taking out the key, turned it in the lock. “You insist on\\nknowing, Basil?” he asked in a low voice.\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“I am delighted,” he answered, smiling. Then he added, somewhat\\nharshly, “You are the one man in the world who is entitled to know\\neverything about me. You have had more to do with my life than you\\nthink”; and, taking up the lamp, he opened the door and went in. A cold\\ncurrent of air passed them, and the light shot up for a moment in a\\nflame of murky orange. He shuddered. “Shut the door behind you,” he\\nwhispered, as he placed the lamp on the table.\\n\\nHallward glanced round him with a puzzled expression. The room looked\\nas if it had not been lived in for years. A faded Flemish tapestry, a\\ncurtained picture, an old Italian _cassone_, and an almost empty\\nbook-case—that was all that it seemed to contain, besides a chair and a\\ntable. As Dorian Gray was lighting a half-burned candle that was\\nstanding on the mantelshelf, he saw that the whole place was covered\\nwith dust and that the carpet was in holes. A mouse ran scuffling\\nbehind the wainscoting. There was a damp odour of mildew.\\n\\n“So you think that it is only God who sees the soul, Basil? Draw that\\ncurtain back, and you will see mine.”\\n\\nThe voice that spoke was cold and cruel. “You are mad, Dorian, or\\nplaying a part,” muttered Hallward, frowning.\\n\\n“You won’t? Then I must do it myself,” said the young man, and he tore\\nthe curtain from its rod and flung it on the ground.\\n\\nAn exclamation of horror broke from the painter’s lips as he saw in the\\ndim light the hideous face on the canvas grinning at him. There was\\nsomething in its expression that filled him with disgust and loathing.\\nGood heavens! it was Dorian Gray’s own face that he was looking at! The\\nhorror, whatever it was, had not yet entirely spoiled that marvellous\\nbeauty. There was still some gold in the thinning hair and some scarlet\\non the sensual mouth. The sodden eyes had kept something of the\\nloveliness of their blue, the noble curves had not yet completely\\npassed away from chiselled nostrils and from plastic throat. Yes, it\\nwas Dorian himself. But who had done it? He seemed to recognize his own\\nbrushwork, and the frame was his own design. The idea was monstrous,\\nyet he felt afraid. He seized the lighted candle, and held it to the\\npicture. In the left-hand corner was his own name, traced in long\\nletters of bright vermilion.\\n\\nIt was some foul parody, some infamous ignoble satire. He had never\\ndone that. Still, it was his own picture. He knew it, and he felt as if\\nhis blood had changed in a moment from fire to sluggish ice. His own\\npicture! What did it mean? Why had it altered? He turned and looked at\\nDorian Gray with the eyes of a sick man. His mouth twitched, and his\\nparched tongue seemed unable to articulate. He passed his hand across\\nhis forehead. It was dank with clammy sweat.\\n\\nThe young man was leaning against the mantelshelf, watching him with\\nthat strange expression that one sees on the faces of those who are\\nabsorbed in a play when some great artist is acting. There was neither\\nreal sorrow in it nor real joy. There was simply the passion of the\\nspectator, with perhaps a flicker of triumph in his eyes. He had taken\\nthe flower out of his coat, and was smelling it, or pretending to do\\nso.\\n\\n“What does this mean?” cried Hallward, at last. His own voice sounded\\nshrill and curious in his ears.\\n\\n“Years ago, when I was a boy,” said Dorian Gray, crushing the flower in\\nhis hand, “you met me, flattered me, and taught me to be vain of my\\ngood looks. One day you introduced me to a friend of yours, who\\nexplained to me the wonder of youth, and you finished a portrait of me\\nthat revealed to me the wonder of beauty. In a mad moment that, even\\nnow, I don’t know whether I regret or not, I made a wish, perhaps you\\nwould call it a prayer....”\\n\\n“I remember it! Oh, how well I remember it! No! the thing is\\nimpossible. The room is damp. Mildew has got into the canvas. The\\npaints I used had some wretched mineral poison in them. I tell you the\\nthing is impossible.”\\n\\n“Ah, what is impossible?” murmured the young man, going over to the\\nwindow and leaning his forehead against the cold, mist-stained glass.\\n\\n“You told me you had destroyed it.”\\n\\n“I was wrong. It has destroyed me.”\\n\\n“I don’t believe it is my picture.”\\n\\n“Can’t you see your ideal in it?” said Dorian bitterly.\\n\\n“My ideal, as you call it...”\\n\\n“As you called it.”\\n\\n“There was nothing evil in it, nothing shameful. You were to me such an\\nideal as I shall never meet again. This is the face of a satyr.”\\n\\n“It is the face of my soul.”\\n\\n“Christ! what a thing I must have worshipped! It has the eyes of a\\ndevil.”\\n\\n“Each of us has heaven and hell in him, Basil,” cried Dorian with a\\nwild gesture of despair.\\n\\nHallward turned again to the portrait and gazed at it. “My God! If it\\nis true,” he exclaimed, “and this is what you have done with your life,\\nwhy, you must be worse even than those who talk against you fancy you\\nto be!” He held the light up again to the canvas and examined it. The\\nsurface seemed to be quite undisturbed and as he had left it. It was\\nfrom within, apparently, that the foulness and horror had come. Through\\nsome strange quickening of inner life the leprosies of sin were slowly\\neating the thing away. The rotting of a corpse in a watery grave was\\nnot so fearful.\\n\\nHis hand shook, and the candle fell from its socket on the floor and\\nlay there sputtering. He placed his foot on it and put it out. Then he\\nflung himself into the rickety chair that was standing by the table and\\nburied his face in his hands.\\n\\n“Good God, Dorian, what a lesson! What an awful lesson!” There was no\\nanswer, but he could hear the young man sobbing at the window. “Pray,\\nDorian, pray,” he murmured. “What is it that one was taught to say in\\none’s boyhood? ‘Lead us not into temptation. Forgive us our sins. Wash\\naway our iniquities.’ Let us say that together. The prayer of your\\npride has been answered. The prayer of your repentance will be answered\\nalso. I worshipped you too much. I am punished for it. You worshipped\\nyourself too much. We are both punished.”\\n\\nDorian Gray turned slowly around and looked at him with tear-dimmed\\neyes. “It is too late, Basil,” he faltered.\\n\\n“It is never too late, Dorian. Let us kneel down and try if we cannot\\nremember a prayer. Isn’t there a verse somewhere, ‘Though your sins be\\nas scarlet, yet I will make them as white as snow’?”\\n\\n“Those words mean nothing to me now.”\\n\\n“Hush! Don’t say that. You have done enough evil in your life. My God!\\nDon’t you see that accursed thing leering at us?”\\n\\nDorian Gray glanced at the picture, and suddenly an uncontrollable\\nfeeling of hatred for Basil Hallward came over him, as though it had\\nbeen suggested to him by the image on the canvas, whispered into his\\near by those grinning lips. The mad passions of a hunted animal stirred\\nwithin him, and he loathed the man who was seated at the table, more\\nthan in his whole life he had ever loathed anything. He glanced wildly\\naround. Something glimmered on the top of the painted chest that faced\\nhim. His eye fell on it. He knew what it was. It was a knife that he\\nhad brought up, some days before, to cut a piece of cord, and had\\nforgotten to take away with him. He moved slowly towards it, passing\\nHallward as he did so. As soon as he got behind him, he seized it and\\nturned round. Hallward stirred in his chair as if he was going to rise.\\nHe rushed at him and dug the knife into the great vein that is behind\\nthe ear, crushing the man’s head down on the table and stabbing again\\nand again.\\n\\nThere was a stifled groan and the horrible sound of some one choking\\nwith blood. Three times the outstretched arms shot up convulsively,\\nwaving grotesque, stiff-fingered hands in the air. He stabbed him twice\\nmore, but the man did not move. Something began to trickle on the\\nfloor. He waited for a moment, still pressing the head down. Then he\\nthrew the knife on the table, and listened.\\n\\nHe could hear nothing, but the drip, drip on the threadbare carpet. He\\nopened the door and went out on the landing. The house was absolutely\\nquiet. No one was about. For a few seconds he stood bending over the\\nbalustrade and peering down into the black seething well of darkness.\\nThen he took out the key and returned to the room, locking himself in\\nas he did so.\\n\\nThe thing was still seated in the chair, straining over the table with\\nbowed head, and humped back, and long fantastic arms. Had it not been\\nfor the red jagged tear in the neck and the clotted black pool that was\\nslowly widening on the table, one would have said that the man was\\nsimply asleep.\\n\\nHow quickly it had all been done! He felt strangely calm, and walking\\nover to the window, opened it and stepped out on the balcony. The wind\\nhad blown the fog away, and the sky was like a monstrous peacock’s\\ntail, starred with myriads of golden eyes. He looked down and saw the\\npoliceman going his rounds and flashing the long beam of his lantern on\\nthe doors of the silent houses. The crimson spot of a prowling hansom\\ngleamed at the corner and then vanished. A woman in a fluttering shawl\\nwas creeping slowly by the railings, staggering as she went. Now and\\nthen she stopped and peered back. Once, she began to sing in a hoarse\\nvoice. The policeman strolled over and said something to her. She\\nstumbled away, laughing. A bitter blast swept across the square. The\\ngas-lamps flickered and became blue, and the leafless trees shook their\\nblack iron branches to and fro. He shivered and went back, closing the\\nwindow behind him.\\n\\nHaving reached the door, he turned the key and opened it. He did not\\neven glance at the murdered man. He felt that the secret of the whole\\nthing was not to realize the situation. The friend who had painted the\\nfatal portrait to which all his misery had been due had gone out of his\\nlife. That was enough.\\n\\nThen he remembered the lamp. It was a rather curious one of Moorish\\nworkmanship, made of dull silver inlaid with arabesques of burnished\\nsteel, and studded with coarse turquoises. Perhaps it might be missed\\nby his servant, and questions would be asked. He hesitated for a\\nmoment, then he turned back and took it from the table. He could not\\nhelp seeing the dead thing. How still it was! How horribly white the\\nlong hands looked! It was like a dreadful wax image.\\n\\nHaving locked the door behind him, he crept quietly downstairs. The\\nwoodwork creaked and seemed to cry out as if in pain. He stopped\\nseveral times and waited. No: everything was still. It was merely the\\nsound of his own footsteps.\\n\\nWhen he reached the library, he saw the bag and coat in the corner.\\nThey must be hidden away somewhere. He unlocked a secret press that was\\nin the wainscoting, a press in which he kept his own curious disguises,\\nand put them into it. He could easily burn them afterwards. Then he\\npulled out his watch. It was twenty minutes to two.\\n\\nHe sat down and began to think. Every year—every month, almost—men were\\nstrangled in England for what he had done. There had been a madness of\\nmurder in the air. Some red star had come too close to the earth....\\nAnd yet, what evidence was there against him? Basil Hallward had left\\nthe house at eleven. No one had seen him come in again. Most of the\\nservants were at Selby Royal. His valet had gone to bed.... Paris! Yes.\\nIt was to Paris that Basil had gone, and by the midnight train, as he\\nhad intended. With his curious reserved habits, it would be months\\nbefore any suspicions would be roused. Months! Everything could be\\ndestroyed long before then.\\n\\nA sudden thought struck him. He put on his fur coat and hat and went\\nout into the hall. There he paused, hearing the slow heavy tread of the\\npoliceman on the pavement outside and seeing the flash of the\\nbull’s-eye reflected in the window. He waited and held his breath.\\n\\nAfter a few moments he drew back the latch and slipped out, shutting\\nthe door very gently behind him. Then he began ringing the bell. In\\nabout five minutes his valet appeared, half-dressed and looking very\\ndrowsy.\\n\\n“I am sorry to have had to wake you up, Francis,” he said, stepping in;\\n“but I had forgotten my latch-key. What time is it?”\\n\\n“Ten minutes past two, sir,” answered the man, looking at the clock and\\nblinking.\\n\\n“Ten minutes past two? How horribly late! You must wake me at nine\\nto-morrow. I have some work to do.”\\n\\n“All right, sir.”\\n\\n“Did any one call this evening?”\\n\\n“Mr. Hallward, sir. He stayed here till eleven, and then he went away\\nto catch his train.”\\n\\n“Oh! I am sorry I didn’t see him. Did he leave any message?”\\n\\n“No, sir, except that he would write to you from Paris, if he did not\\nfind you at the club.”\\n\\n“That will do, Francis. Don’t forget to call me at nine to-morrow.”\\n\\n“No, sir.”\\n\\nThe man shambled down the passage in his slippers.\\n\\nDorian Gray threw his hat and coat upon the table and passed into the\\nlibrary. For a quarter of an hour he walked up and down the room,\\nbiting his lip and thinking. Then he took down the Blue Book from one\\nof the shelves and began to turn over the leaves. “Alan Campbell, 152,\\nHertford Street, Mayfair.” Yes; that was the man he wanted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV.\\n\\n\\nAt nine o’clock the next morning his servant came in with a cup of\\nchocolate on a tray and opened the shutters. Dorian was sleeping quite\\npeacefully, lying on his right side, with one hand underneath his\\ncheek. He looked like a boy who had been tired out with play, or study.\\n\\nThe man had to touch him twice on the shoulder before he woke, and as\\nhe opened his eyes a faint smile passed across his lips, as though he\\nhad been lost in some delightful dream. Yet he had not dreamed at all.\\nHis night had been untroubled by any images of pleasure or of pain. But\\nyouth smiles without any reason. It is one of its chiefest charms.\\n\\nHe turned round, and leaning upon his elbow, began to sip his\\nchocolate. The mellow November sun came streaming into the room. The\\nsky was bright, and there was a genial warmth in the air. It was almost\\nlike a morning in May.\\n\\nGradually the events of the preceding night crept with silent,\\nblood-stained feet into his brain and reconstructed themselves there\\nwith terrible distinctness. He winced at the memory of all that he had\\nsuffered, and for a moment the same curious feeling of loathing for\\nBasil Hallward that had made him kill him as he sat in the chair came\\nback to him, and he grew cold with passion. The dead man was still\\nsitting there, too, and in the sunlight now. How horrible that was!\\nSuch hideous things were for the darkness, not for the day.\\n\\nHe felt that if he brooded on what he had gone through he would sicken\\nor grow mad. There were sins whose fascination was more in the memory\\nthan in the doing of them, strange triumphs that gratified the pride\\nmore than the passions, and gave to the intellect a quickened sense of\\njoy, greater than any joy they brought, or could ever bring, to the\\nsenses. But this was not one of them. It was a thing to be driven out\\nof the mind, to be drugged with poppies, to be strangled lest it might\\nstrangle one itself.\\n\\nWhen the half-hour struck, he passed his hand across his forehead, and\\nthen got up hastily and dressed himself with even more than his usual\\ncare, giving a good deal of attention to the choice of his necktie and\\nscarf-pin and changing his rings more than once. He spent a long time\\nalso over breakfast, tasting the various dishes, talking to his valet\\nabout some new liveries that he was thinking of getting made for the\\nservants at Selby, and going through his correspondence. At some of the\\nletters, he smiled. Three of them bored him. One he read several times\\nover and then tore up with a slight look of annoyance in his face.\\n“That awful thing, a woman’s memory!” as Lord Henry had once said.\\n\\nAfter he had drunk his cup of black coffee, he wiped his lips slowly\\nwith a napkin, motioned to his servant to wait, and going over to the\\ntable, sat down and wrote two letters. One he put in his pocket, the\\nother he handed to the valet.\\n\\n“Take this round to 152, Hertford Street, Francis, and if Mr. Campbell\\nis out of town, get his address.”\\n\\nAs soon as he was alone, he lit a cigarette and began sketching upon a\\npiece of paper, drawing first flowers and bits of architecture, and\\nthen human faces. Suddenly he remarked that every face that he drew\\nseemed to have a fantastic likeness to Basil Hallward. He frowned, and\\ngetting up, went over to the book-case and took out a volume at hazard.\\nHe was determined that he would not think about what had happened until\\nit became absolutely necessary that he should do so.\\n\\nWhen he had stretched himself on the sofa, he looked at the title-page\\nof the book. It was Gautier’s “Émaux et Camées”, Charpentier’s\\nJapanese-paper edition, with the Jacquemart etching. The binding was of\\ncitron-green leather, with a design of gilt trellis-work and dotted\\npomegranates. It had been given to him by Adrian Singleton. As he\\nturned over the pages, his eye fell on the poem about the hand of\\nLacenaire, the cold yellow hand “_du supplice encore mal lavée_,” with\\nits downy red hairs and its “_doigts de faune_.” He glanced at his own\\nwhite taper fingers, shuddering slightly in spite of himself, and\\npassed on, till he came to those lovely stanzas upon Venice:\\n\\nSur une gamme chromatique,\\n    Le sein de perles ruisselant,\\nLa Vénus de l’Adriatique\\n    Sort de l’eau son corps rose et blanc.\\n\\nLes dômes, sur l’azur des ondes\\n    Suivant la phrase au pur contour,\\nS’enflent comme des gorges rondes\\n    Que soulève un soupir d’amour.\\n\\nL’esquif aborde et me dépose,\\n    Jetant son amarre au pilier,\\nDevant une façade rose,\\n    Sur le marbre d’un escalier.\\n\\n\\nHow exquisite they were! As one read them, one seemed to be floating\\ndown the green water-ways of the pink and pearl city, seated in a black\\ngondola with silver prow and trailing curtains. The mere lines looked\\nto him like those straight lines of turquoise-blue that follow one as\\none pushes out to the Lido. The sudden flashes of colour reminded him\\nof the gleam of the opal-and-iris-throated birds that flutter round the\\ntall honeycombed Campanile, or stalk, with such stately grace, through\\nthe dim, dust-stained arcades. Leaning back with half-closed eyes, he\\nkept saying over and over to himself:\\n\\n“Devant une façade rose,\\nSur le marbre d’un escalier.”\\n\\n\\nThe whole of Venice was in those two lines. He remembered the autumn\\nthat he had passed there, and a wonderful love that had stirred him to\\nmad delightful follies. There was romance in every place. But Venice,\\nlike Oxford, had kept the background for romance, and, to the true\\nromantic, background was everything, or almost everything. Basil had\\nbeen with him part of the time, and had gone wild over Tintoret. Poor\\nBasil! What a horrible way for a man to die!\\n\\nHe sighed, and took up the volume again, and tried to forget. He read\\nof the swallows that fly in and out of the little _café_ at Smyrna\\nwhere the Hadjis sit counting their amber beads and the turbaned\\nmerchants smoke their long tasselled pipes and talk gravely to each\\nother; he read of the Obelisk in the Place de la Concorde that weeps\\ntears of granite in its lonely sunless exile and longs to be back by\\nthe hot, lotus-covered Nile, where there are Sphinxes, and rose-red\\nibises, and white vultures with gilded claws, and crocodiles with small\\nberyl eyes that crawl over the green steaming mud; he began to brood\\nover those verses which, drawing music from kiss-stained marble, tell\\nof that curious statue that Gautier compares to a contralto voice, the\\n“_monstre charmant_” that couches in the porphyry-room of the Louvre.\\nBut after a time the book fell from his hand. He grew nervous, and a\\nhorrible fit of terror came over him. What if Alan Campbell should be\\nout of England? Days would elapse before he could come back. Perhaps he\\nmight refuse to come. What could he do then? Every moment was of vital\\nimportance.\\n\\nThey had been great friends once, five years before—almost inseparable,\\nindeed. Then the intimacy had come suddenly to an end. When they met in\\nsociety now, it was only Dorian Gray who smiled: Alan Campbell never\\ndid.\\n\\nHe was an extremely clever young man, though he had no real\\nappreciation of the visible arts, and whatever little sense of the\\nbeauty of poetry he possessed he had gained entirely from Dorian. His\\ndominant intellectual passion was for science. At Cambridge he had\\nspent a great deal of his time working in the laboratory, and had taken\\na good class in the Natural Science Tripos of his year. Indeed, he was\\nstill devoted to the study of chemistry, and had a laboratory of his\\nown in which he used to shut himself up all day long, greatly to the\\nannoyance of his mother, who had set her heart on his standing for\\nParliament and had a vague idea that a chemist was a person who made up\\nprescriptions. He was an excellent musician, however, as well, and\\nplayed both the violin and the piano better than most amateurs. In\\nfact, it was music that had first brought him and Dorian Gray\\ntogether—music and that indefinable attraction that Dorian seemed to be\\nable to exercise whenever he wished—and, indeed, exercised often\\nwithout being conscious of it. They had met at Lady Berkshire’s the\\nnight that Rubinstein played there, and after that used to be always\\nseen together at the opera and wherever good music was going on. For\\neighteen months their intimacy lasted. Campbell was always either at\\nSelby Royal or in Grosvenor Square. To him, as to many others, Dorian\\nGray was the type of everything that is wonderful and fascinating in\\nlife. Whether or not a quarrel had taken place between them no one ever\\nknew. But suddenly people remarked that they scarcely spoke when they\\nmet and that Campbell seemed always to go away early from any party at\\nwhich Dorian Gray was present. He had changed, too—was strangely\\nmelancholy at times, appeared almost to dislike hearing music, and\\nwould never himself play, giving as his excuse, when he was called\\nupon, that he was so absorbed in science that he had no time left in\\nwhich to practise. And this was certainly true. Every day he seemed to\\nbecome more interested in biology, and his name appeared once or twice\\nin some of the scientific reviews in connection with certain curious\\nexperiments.\\n\\nThis was the man Dorian Gray was waiting for. Every second he kept\\nglancing at the clock. As the minutes went by he became horribly\\nagitated. At last he got up and began to pace up and down the room,\\nlooking like a beautiful caged thing. He took long stealthy strides.\\nHis hands were curiously cold.\\n\\nThe suspense became unbearable. Time seemed to him to be crawling with\\nfeet of lead, while he by monstrous winds was being swept towards the\\njagged edge of some black cleft of precipice. He knew what was waiting\\nfor him there; saw it, indeed, and, shuddering, crushed with dank hands\\nhis burning lids as though he would have robbed the very brain of sight\\nand driven the eyeballs back into their cave. It was useless. The brain\\nhad its own food on which it battened, and the imagination, made\\ngrotesque by terror, twisted and distorted as a living thing by pain,\\ndanced like some foul puppet on a stand and grinned through moving\\nmasks. Then, suddenly, time stopped for him. Yes: that blind,\\nslow-breathing thing crawled no more, and horrible thoughts, time being\\ndead, raced nimbly on in front, and dragged a hideous future from its\\ngrave, and showed it to him. He stared at it. Its very horror made him\\nstone.\\n\\nAt last the door opened and his servant entered. He turned glazed eyes\\nupon him.\\n\\n“Mr. Campbell, sir,” said the man.\\n\\nA sigh of relief broke from his parched lips, and the colour came back\\nto his cheeks.\\n\\n“Ask him to come in at once, Francis.” He felt that he was himself\\nagain. His mood of cowardice had passed away.\\n\\nThe man bowed and retired. In a few moments, Alan Campbell walked in,\\nlooking very stern and rather pale, his pallor being intensified by his\\ncoal-black hair and dark eyebrows.\\n\\n“Alan! This is kind of you. I thank you for coming.”\\n\\n“I had intended never to enter your house again, Gray. But you said it\\nwas a matter of life and death.” His voice was hard and cold. He spoke\\nwith slow deliberation. There was a look of contempt in the steady\\nsearching gaze that he turned on Dorian. He kept his hands in the\\npockets of his Astrakhan coat, and seemed not to have noticed the\\ngesture with which he had been greeted.\\n\\n“Yes: it is a matter of life and death, Alan, and to more than one\\nperson. Sit down.”\\n\\nCampbell took a chair by the table, and Dorian sat opposite to him. The\\ntwo men’s eyes met. In Dorian’s there was infinite pity. He knew that\\nwhat he was going to do was dreadful.\\n\\nAfter a strained moment of silence, he leaned across and said, very\\nquietly, but watching the effect of each word upon the face of him he\\nhad sent for, “Alan, in a locked room at the top of this house, a room\\nto which nobody but myself has access, a dead man is seated at a table.\\nHe has been dead ten hours now. Don’t stir, and don’t look at me like\\nthat. Who the man is, why he died, how he died, are matters that do not\\nconcern you. What you have to do is this—”\\n\\n“Stop, Gray. I don’t want to know anything further. Whether what you\\nhave told me is true or not true doesn’t concern me. I entirely decline\\nto be mixed up in your life. Keep your horrible secrets to yourself.\\nThey don’t interest me any more.”\\n\\n“Alan, they will have to interest you. This one will have to interest\\nyou. I am awfully sorry for you, Alan. But I can’t help myself. You are\\nthe one man who is able to save me. I am forced to bring you into the\\nmatter. I have no option. Alan, you are scientific. You know about\\nchemistry and things of that kind. You have made experiments. What you\\nhave got to do is to destroy the thing that is upstairs—to destroy it\\nso that not a vestige of it will be left. Nobody saw this person come\\ninto the house. Indeed, at the present moment he is supposed to be in\\nParis. He will not be missed for months. When he is missed, there must\\nbe no trace of him found here. You, Alan, you must change him, and\\neverything that belongs to him, into a handful of ashes that I may\\nscatter in the air.”\\n\\n“You are mad, Dorian.”\\n\\n“Ah! I was waiting for you to call me Dorian.”\\n\\n“You are mad, I tell you—mad to imagine that I would raise a finger to\\nhelp you, mad to make this monstrous confession. I will have nothing to\\ndo with this matter, whatever it is. Do you think I am going to peril\\nmy reputation for you? What is it to me what devil’s work you are up\\nto?”\\n\\n“It was suicide, Alan.”\\n\\n“I am glad of that. But who drove him to it? You, I should fancy.”\\n\\n“Do you still refuse to do this for me?”\\n\\n“Of course I refuse. I will have absolutely nothing to do with it. I\\ndon’t care what shame comes on you. You deserve it all. I should not be\\nsorry to see you disgraced, publicly disgraced. How dare you ask me, of\\nall men in the world, to mix myself up in this horror? I should have\\nthought you knew more about people’s characters. Your friend Lord Henry\\nWotton can’t have taught you much about psychology, whatever else he\\nhas taught you. Nothing will induce me to stir a step to help you. You\\nhave come to the wrong man. Go to some of your friends. Don’t come to\\nme.”\\n\\n“Alan, it was murder. I killed him. You don’t know what he had made me\\nsuffer. Whatever my life is, he had more to do with the making or the\\nmarring of it than poor Harry has had. He may not have intended it, the\\nresult was the same.”\\n\\n“Murder! Good God, Dorian, is that what you have come to? I shall not\\ninform upon you. It is not my business. Besides, without my stirring in\\nthe matter, you are certain to be arrested. Nobody ever commits a crime\\nwithout doing something stupid. But I will have nothing to do with it.”\\n\\n“You must have something to do with it. Wait, wait a moment; listen to\\nme. Only listen, Alan. All I ask of you is to perform a certain\\nscientific experiment. You go to hospitals and dead-houses, and the\\nhorrors that you do there don’t affect you. If in some hideous\\ndissecting-room or fetid laboratory you found this man lying on a\\nleaden table with red gutters scooped out in it for the blood to flow\\nthrough, you would simply look upon him as an admirable subject. You\\nwould not turn a hair. You would not believe that you were doing\\nanything wrong. On the contrary, you would probably feel that you were\\nbenefiting the human race, or increasing the sum of knowledge in the\\nworld, or gratifying intellectual curiosity, or something of that kind.\\nWhat I want you to do is merely what you have often done before.\\nIndeed, to destroy a body must be far less horrible than what you are\\naccustomed to work at. And, remember, it is the only piece of evidence\\nagainst me. If it is discovered, I am lost; and it is sure to be\\ndiscovered unless you help me.”\\n\\n“I have no desire to help you. You forget that. I am simply indifferent\\nto the whole thing. It has nothing to do with me.”\\n\\n“Alan, I entreat you. Think of the position I am in. Just before you\\ncame I almost fainted with terror. You may know terror yourself some\\nday. No! don’t think of that. Look at the matter purely from the\\nscientific point of view. You don’t inquire where the dead things on\\nwhich you experiment come from. Don’t inquire now. I have told you too\\nmuch as it is. But I beg of you to do this. We were friends once,\\nAlan.”\\n\\n“Don’t speak about those days, Dorian—they are dead.”\\n\\n“The dead linger sometimes. The man upstairs will not go away. He is\\nsitting at the table with bowed head and outstretched arms. Alan! Alan!\\nIf you don’t come to my assistance, I am ruined. Why, they will hang\\nme, Alan! Don’t you understand? They will hang me for what I have\\ndone.”\\n\\n“There is no good in prolonging this scene. I absolutely refuse to do\\nanything in the matter. It is insane of you to ask me.”\\n\\n“You refuse?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“I entreat you, Alan.”\\n\\n“It is useless.”\\n\\nThe same look of pity came into Dorian Gray’s eyes. Then he stretched\\nout his hand, took a piece of paper, and wrote something on it. He read\\nit over twice, folded it carefully, and pushed it across the table.\\nHaving done this, he got up and went over to the window.\\n\\nCampbell looked at him in surprise, and then took up the paper, and\\nopened it. As he read it, his face became ghastly pale and he fell back\\nin his chair. A horrible sense of sickness came over him. He felt as if\\nhis heart was beating itself to death in some empty hollow.\\n\\nAfter two or three minutes of terrible silence, Dorian turned round and\\ncame and stood behind him, putting his hand upon his shoulder.\\n\\n“I am so sorry for you, Alan,” he murmured, “but you leave me no\\nalternative. I have a letter written already. Here it is. You see the\\naddress. If you don’t help me, I must send it. If you don’t help me, I\\nwill send it. You know what the result will be. But you are going to\\nhelp me. It is impossible for you to refuse now. I tried to spare you.\\nYou will do me the justice to admit that. You were stern, harsh,\\noffensive. You treated me as no man has ever dared to treat me—no\\nliving man, at any rate. I bore it all. Now it is for me to dictate\\nterms.”\\n\\nCampbell buried his face in his hands, and a shudder passed through\\nhim.\\n\\n“Yes, it is my turn to dictate terms, Alan. You know what they are. The\\nthing is quite simple. Come, don’t work yourself into this fever. The\\nthing has to be done. Face it, and do it.”\\n\\nA groan broke from Campbell’s lips and he shivered all over. The\\nticking of the clock on the mantelpiece seemed to him to be dividing\\ntime into separate atoms of agony, each of which was too terrible to be\\nborne. He felt as if an iron ring was being slowly tightened round his\\nforehead, as if the disgrace with which he was threatened had already\\ncome upon him. The hand upon his shoulder weighed like a hand of lead.\\nIt was intolerable. It seemed to crush him.\\n\\n“Come, Alan, you must decide at once.”\\n\\n“I cannot do it,” he said, mechanically, as though words could alter\\nthings.\\n\\n“You must. You have no choice. Don’t delay.”\\n\\nHe hesitated a moment. “Is there a fire in the room upstairs?”\\n\\n“Yes, there is a gas-fire with asbestos.”\\n\\n“I shall have to go home and get some things from the laboratory.”\\n\\n“No, Alan, you must not leave the house. Write out on a sheet of\\nnotepaper what you want and my servant will take a cab and bring the\\nthings back to you.”\\n\\nCampbell scrawled a few lines, blotted them, and addressed an envelope\\nto his assistant. Dorian took the note up and read it carefully. Then\\nhe rang the bell and gave it to his valet, with orders to return as\\nsoon as possible and to bring the things with him.\\n\\nAs the hall door shut, Campbell started nervously, and having got up\\nfrom the chair, went over to the chimney-piece. He was shivering with a\\nkind of ague. For nearly twenty minutes, neither of the men spoke. A\\nfly buzzed noisily about the room, and the ticking of the clock was\\nlike the beat of a hammer.\\n\\nAs the chime struck one, Campbell turned round, and looking at Dorian\\nGray, saw that his eyes were filled with tears. There was something in\\nthe purity and refinement of that sad face that seemed to enrage him.\\n“You are infamous, absolutely infamous!” he muttered.\\n\\n“Hush, Alan. You have saved my life,” said Dorian.\\n\\n“Your life? Good heavens! what a life that is! You have gone from\\ncorruption to corruption, and now you have culminated in crime. In\\ndoing what I am going to do—what you force me to do—it is not of your\\nlife that I am thinking.”\\n\\n“Ah, Alan,” murmured Dorian with a sigh, “I wish you had a thousandth\\npart of the pity for me that I have for you.” He turned away as he\\nspoke and stood looking out at the garden. Campbell made no answer.\\n\\nAfter about ten minutes a knock came to the door, and the servant\\nentered, carrying a large mahogany chest of chemicals, with a long coil\\nof steel and platinum wire and two rather curiously shaped iron clamps.\\n\\n“Shall I leave the things here, sir?” he asked Campbell.\\n\\n“Yes,” said Dorian. “And I am afraid, Francis, that I have another\\nerrand for you. What is the name of the man at Richmond who supplies\\nSelby with orchids?”\\n\\n“Harden, sir.”\\n\\n“Yes—Harden. You must go down to Richmond at once, see Harden\\npersonally, and tell him to send twice as many orchids as I ordered,\\nand to have as few white ones as possible. In fact, I don’t want any\\nwhite ones. It is a lovely day, Francis, and Richmond is a very pretty\\nplace—otherwise I wouldn’t bother you about it.”\\n\\n“No trouble, sir. At what time shall I be back?”\\n\\nDorian looked at Campbell. “How long will your experiment take, Alan?”\\nhe said in a calm indifferent voice. The presence of a third person in\\nthe room seemed to give him extraordinary courage.\\n\\nCampbell frowned and bit his lip. “It will take about five hours,” he\\nanswered.\\n\\n“It will be time enough, then, if you are back at half-past seven,\\nFrancis. Or stay: just leave my things out for dressing. You can have\\nthe evening to yourself. I am not dining at home, so I shall not want\\nyou.”\\n\\n“Thank you, sir,” said the man, leaving the room.\\n\\n“Now, Alan, there is not a moment to be lost. How heavy this chest is!\\nI’ll take it for you. You bring the other things.” He spoke rapidly and\\nin an authoritative manner. Campbell felt dominated by him. They left\\nthe room together.\\n\\nWhen they reached the top landing, Dorian took out the key and turned\\nit in the lock. Then he stopped, and a troubled look came into his\\neyes. He shuddered. “I don’t think I can go in, Alan,” he murmured.\\n\\n“It is nothing to me. I don’t require you,” said Campbell coldly.\\n\\nDorian half opened the door. As he did so, he saw the face of his\\nportrait leering in the sunlight. On the floor in front of it the torn\\ncurtain was lying. He remembered that the night before he had\\nforgotten, for the first time in his life, to hide the fatal canvas,\\nand was about to rush forward, when he drew back with a shudder.\\n\\nWhat was that loathsome red dew that gleamed, wet and glistening, on\\none of the hands, as though the canvas had sweated blood? How horrible\\nit was!—more horrible, it seemed to him for the moment, than the silent\\nthing that he knew was stretched across the table, the thing whose\\ngrotesque misshapen shadow on the spotted carpet showed him that it had\\nnot stirred, but was still there, as he had left it.\\n\\nHe heaved a deep breath, opened the door a little wider, and with\\nhalf-closed eyes and averted head, walked quickly in, determined that\\nhe would not look even once upon the dead man. Then, stooping down and\\ntaking up the gold-and-purple hanging, he flung it right over the\\npicture.\\n\\nThere he stopped, feeling afraid to turn round, and his eyes fixed\\nthemselves on the intricacies of the pattern before him. He heard\\nCampbell bringing in the heavy chest, and the irons, and the other\\nthings that he had required for his dreadful work. He began to wonder\\nif he and Basil Hallward had ever met, and, if so, what they had\\nthought of each other.\\n\\n“Leave me now,” said a stern voice behind him.\\n\\nHe turned and hurried out, just conscious that the dead man had been\\nthrust back into the chair and that Campbell was gazing into a\\nglistening yellow face. As he was going downstairs, he heard the key\\nbeing turned in the lock.\\n\\nIt was long after seven when Campbell came back into the library. He\\nwas pale, but absolutely calm. “I have done what you asked me to do,”\\nhe muttered. “And now, good-bye. Let us never see each other again.”\\n\\n“You have saved me from ruin, Alan. I cannot forget that,” said Dorian\\nsimply.\\n\\nAs soon as Campbell had left, he went upstairs. There was a horrible\\nsmell of nitric acid in the room. But the thing that had been sitting\\nat the table was gone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV.\\n\\n\\nThat evening, at eight-thirty, exquisitely dressed and wearing a large\\nbutton-hole of Parma violets, Dorian Gray was ushered into Lady\\nNarborough’s drawing-room by bowing servants. His forehead was\\nthrobbing with maddened nerves, and he felt wildly excited, but his\\nmanner as he bent over his hostess’s hand was as easy and graceful as\\never. Perhaps one never seems so much at one’s ease as when one has to\\nplay a part. Certainly no one looking at Dorian Gray that night could\\nhave believed that he had passed through a tragedy as horrible as any\\ntragedy of our age. Those finely shaped fingers could never have\\nclutched a knife for sin, nor those smiling lips have cried out on God\\nand goodness. He himself could not help wondering at the calm of his\\ndemeanour, and for a moment felt keenly the terrible pleasure of a\\ndouble life.\\n\\nIt was a small party, got up rather in a hurry by Lady Narborough, who\\nwas a very clever woman with what Lord Henry used to describe as the\\nremains of really remarkable ugliness. She had proved an excellent wife\\nto one of our most tedious ambassadors, and having buried her husband\\nproperly in a marble mausoleum, which she had herself designed, and\\nmarried off her daughters to some rich, rather elderly men, she devoted\\nherself now to the pleasures of French fiction, French cookery, and\\nFrench _esprit_ when she could get it.\\n\\nDorian was one of her especial favourites, and she always told him that\\nshe was extremely glad she had not met him in early life. “I know, my\\ndear, I should have fallen madly in love with you,” she used to say,\\n“and thrown my bonnet right over the mills for your sake. It is most\\nfortunate that you were not thought of at the time. As it was, our\\nbonnets were so unbecoming, and the mills were so occupied in trying to\\nraise the wind, that I never had even a flirtation with anybody.\\nHowever, that was all Narborough’s fault. He was dreadfully\\nshort-sighted, and there is no pleasure in taking in a husband who\\nnever sees anything.”\\n\\nHer guests this evening were rather tedious. The fact was, as she\\nexplained to Dorian, behind a very shabby fan, one of her married\\ndaughters had come up quite suddenly to stay with her, and, to make\\nmatters worse, had actually brought her husband with her. “I think it\\nis most unkind of her, my dear,” she whispered. “Of course I go and\\nstay with them every summer after I come from Homburg, but then an old\\nwoman like me must have fresh air sometimes, and besides, I really wake\\nthem up. You don’t know what an existence they lead down there. It is\\npure unadulterated country life. They get up early, because they have\\nso much to do, and go to bed early, because they have so little to\\nthink about. There has not been a scandal in the neighbourhood since\\nthe time of Queen Elizabeth, and consequently they all fall asleep\\nafter dinner. You shan’t sit next either of them. You shall sit by me\\nand amuse me.”\\n\\nDorian murmured a graceful compliment and looked round the room. Yes:\\nit was certainly a tedious party. Two of the people he had never seen\\nbefore, and the others consisted of Ernest Harrowden, one of those\\nmiddle-aged mediocrities so common in London clubs who have no enemies,\\nbut are thoroughly disliked by their friends; Lady Ruxton, an\\noverdressed woman of forty-seven, with a hooked nose, who was always\\ntrying to get herself compromised, but was so peculiarly plain that to\\nher great disappointment no one would ever believe anything against\\nher; Mrs. Erlynne, a pushing nobody, with a delightful lisp and\\nVenetian-red hair; Lady Alice Chapman, his hostess’s daughter, a dowdy\\ndull girl, with one of those characteristic British faces that, once\\nseen, are never remembered; and her husband, a red-cheeked,\\nwhite-whiskered creature who, like so many of his class, was under the\\nimpression that inordinate joviality can atone for an entire lack of\\nideas.\\n\\nHe was rather sorry he had come, till Lady Narborough, looking at the\\ngreat ormolu gilt clock that sprawled in gaudy curves on the\\nmauve-draped mantelshelf, exclaimed: “How horrid of Henry Wotton to be\\nso late! I sent round to him this morning on chance and he promised\\nfaithfully not to disappoint me.”\\n\\nIt was some consolation that Harry was to be there, and when the door\\nopened and he heard his slow musical voice lending charm to some\\ninsincere apology, he ceased to feel bored.\\n\\nBut at dinner he could not eat anything. Plate after plate went away\\nuntasted. Lady Narborough kept scolding him for what she called “an\\ninsult to poor Adolphe, who invented the _menu_ specially for you,” and\\nnow and then Lord Henry looked across at him, wondering at his silence\\nand abstracted manner. From time to time the butler filled his glass\\nwith champagne. He drank eagerly, and his thirst seemed to increase.\\n\\n“Dorian,” said Lord Henry at last, as the _chaud-froid_ was being\\nhanded round, “what is the matter with you to-night? You are quite out\\nof sorts.”\\n\\n“I believe he is in love,” cried Lady Narborough, “and that he is\\nafraid to tell me for fear I should be jealous. He is quite right. I\\ncertainly should.”\\n\\n“Dear Lady Narborough,” murmured Dorian, smiling, “I have not been in\\nlove for a whole week—not, in fact, since Madame de Ferrol left town.”\\n\\n“How you men can fall in love with that woman!” exclaimed the old lady.\\n“I really cannot understand it.”\\n\\n“It is simply because she remembers you when you were a little girl,\\nLady Narborough,” said Lord Henry. “She is the one link between us and\\nyour short frocks.”\\n\\n“She does not remember my short frocks at all, Lord Henry. But I\\nremember her very well at Vienna thirty years ago, and how _décolletée_\\nshe was then.”\\n\\n“She is still _décolletée_,” he answered, taking an olive in his long\\nfingers; “and when she is in a very smart gown she looks like an\\n_édition de luxe_ of a bad French novel. She is really wonderful, and\\nfull of surprises. Her capacity for family affection is extraordinary.\\nWhen her third husband died, her hair turned quite gold from grief.”\\n\\n“How can you, Harry!” cried Dorian.\\n\\n“It is a most romantic explanation,” laughed the hostess. “But her\\nthird husband, Lord Henry! You don’t mean to say Ferrol is the fourth?”\\n\\n“Certainly, Lady Narborough.”\\n\\n“I don’t believe a word of it.”\\n\\n“Well, ask Mr. Gray. He is one of her most intimate friends.”\\n\\n“Is it true, Mr. Gray?”\\n\\n“She assures me so, Lady Narborough,” said Dorian. “I asked her\\nwhether, like Marguerite de Navarre, she had their hearts embalmed and\\nhung at her girdle. She told me she didn’t, because none of them had\\nhad any hearts at all.”\\n\\n“Four husbands! Upon my word that is _trop de zêle_.”\\n\\n“_Trop d’audace_, I tell her,” said Dorian.\\n\\n“Oh! she is audacious enough for anything, my dear. And what is Ferrol\\nlike? I don’t know him.”\\n\\n“The husbands of very beautiful women belong to the criminal classes,”\\nsaid Lord Henry, sipping his wine.\\n\\nLady Narborough hit him with her fan. “Lord Henry, I am not at all\\nsurprised that the world says that you are extremely wicked.”\\n\\n“But what world says that?” asked Lord Henry, elevating his eyebrows.\\n“It can only be the next world. This world and I are on excellent\\nterms.”\\n\\n“Everybody I know says you are very wicked,” cried the old lady,\\nshaking her head.\\n\\nLord Henry looked serious for some moments. “It is perfectly\\nmonstrous,” he said, at last, “the way people go about nowadays saying\\nthings against one behind one’s back that are absolutely and entirely\\ntrue.”\\n\\n“Isn’t he incorrigible?” cried Dorian, leaning forward in his chair.\\n\\n“I hope so,” said his hostess, laughing. “But really, if you all\\nworship Madame de Ferrol in this ridiculous way, I shall have to marry\\nagain so as to be in the fashion.”\\n\\n“You will never marry again, Lady Narborough,” broke in Lord Henry.\\n“You were far too happy. When a woman marries again, it is because she\\ndetested her first husband. When a man marries again, it is because he\\nadored his first wife. Women try their luck; men risk theirs.”\\n\\n“Narborough wasn’t perfect,” cried the old lady.\\n\\n“If he had been, you would not have loved him, my dear lady,” was the\\nrejoinder. “Women love us for our defects. If we have enough of them,\\nthey will forgive us everything, even our intellects. You will never\\nask me to dinner again after saying this, I am afraid, Lady Narborough,\\nbut it is quite true.”\\n\\n“Of course it is true, Lord Henry. If we women did not love you for\\nyour defects, where would you all be? Not one of you would ever be\\nmarried. You would be a set of unfortunate bachelors. Not, however,\\nthat that would alter you much. Nowadays all the married men live like\\nbachelors, and all the bachelors like married men.”\\n\\n“_Fin de siêcle_,” murmured Lord Henry.\\n\\n“_Fin du globe_,” answered his hostess.\\n\\n“I wish it were _fin du globe_,” said Dorian with a sigh. “Life is a\\ngreat disappointment.”\\n\\n“Ah, my dear,” cried Lady Narborough, putting on her gloves, “don’t\\ntell me that you have exhausted life. When a man says that one knows\\nthat life has exhausted him. Lord Henry is very wicked, and I sometimes\\nwish that I had been; but you are made to be good—you look so good. I\\nmust find you a nice wife. Lord Henry, don’t you think that Mr. Gray\\nshould get married?”\\n\\n“I am always telling him so, Lady Narborough,” said Lord Henry with a\\nbow.\\n\\n“Well, we must look out for a suitable match for him. I shall go\\nthrough Debrett carefully to-night and draw out a list of all the\\neligible young ladies.”\\n\\n“With their ages, Lady Narborough?” asked Dorian.\\n\\n“Of course, with their ages, slightly edited. But nothing must be done\\nin a hurry. I want it to be what _The Morning Post_ calls a suitable\\nalliance, and I want you both to be happy.”\\n\\n“What nonsense people talk about happy marriages!” exclaimed Lord\\nHenry. “A man can be happy with any woman, as long as he does not love\\nher.”\\n\\n“Ah! what a cynic you are!” cried the old lady, pushing back her chair\\nand nodding to Lady Ruxton. “You must come and dine with me soon again.\\nYou are really an admirable tonic, much better than what Sir Andrew\\nprescribes for me. You must tell me what people you would like to meet,\\nthough. I want it to be a delightful gathering.”\\n\\n“I like men who have a future and women who have a past,” he answered.\\n“Or do you think that would make it a petticoat party?”\\n\\n“I fear so,” she said, laughing, as she stood up. “A thousand pardons,\\nmy dear Lady Ruxton,” she added, “I didn’t see you hadn’t finished your\\ncigarette.”\\n\\n“Never mind, Lady Narborough. I smoke a great deal too much. I am going\\nto limit myself, for the future.”\\n\\n“Pray don’t, Lady Ruxton,” said Lord Henry. “Moderation is a fatal\\nthing. Enough is as bad as a meal. More than enough is as good as a\\nfeast.”\\n\\nLady Ruxton glanced at him curiously. “You must come and explain that\\nto me some afternoon, Lord Henry. It sounds a fascinating theory,” she\\nmurmured, as she swept out of the room.\\n\\n“Now, mind you don’t stay too long over your politics and scandal,”\\ncried Lady Narborough from the door. “If you do, we are sure to\\nsquabble upstairs.”\\n\\nThe men laughed, and Mr. Chapman got up solemnly from the foot of the\\ntable and came up to the top. Dorian Gray changed his seat and went and\\nsat by Lord Henry. Mr. Chapman began to talk in a loud voice about the\\nsituation in the House of Commons. He guffawed at his adversaries. The\\nword _doctrinaire_—word full of terror to the British mind—reappeared\\nfrom time to time between his explosions. An alliterative prefix served\\nas an ornament of oratory. He hoisted the Union Jack on the pinnacles\\nof thought. The inherited stupidity of the race—sound English common\\nsense he jovially termed it—was shown to be the proper bulwark for\\nsociety.\\n\\nA smile curved Lord Henry’s lips, and he turned round and looked at\\nDorian.\\n\\n“Are you better, my dear fellow?” he asked. “You seemed rather out of\\nsorts at dinner.”\\n\\n“I am quite well, Harry. I am tired. That is all.”\\n\\n“You were charming last night. The little duchess is quite devoted to\\nyou. She tells me she is going down to Selby.”\\n\\n“She has promised to come on the twentieth.”\\n\\n“Is Monmouth to be there, too?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes, Harry.”\\n\\n“He bores me dreadfully, almost as much as he bores her. She is very\\nclever, too clever for a woman. She lacks the indefinable charm of\\nweakness. It is the feet of clay that make the gold of the image\\nprecious. Her feet are very pretty, but they are not feet of clay.\\nWhite porcelain feet, if you like. They have been through the fire, and\\nwhat fire does not destroy, it hardens. She has had experiences.”\\n\\n“How long has she been married?” asked Dorian.\\n\\n“An eternity, she tells me. I believe, according to the peerage, it is\\nten years, but ten years with Monmouth must have been like eternity,\\nwith time thrown in. Who else is coming?”\\n\\n“Oh, the Willoughbys, Lord Rugby and his wife, our hostess, Geoffrey\\nClouston, the usual set. I have asked Lord Grotrian.”\\n\\n“I like him,” said Lord Henry. “A great many people don’t, but I find\\nhim charming. He atones for being occasionally somewhat overdressed by\\nbeing always absolutely over-educated. He is a very modern type.”\\n\\n“I don’t know if he will be able to come, Harry. He may have to go to\\nMonte Carlo with his father.”\\n\\n“Ah! what a nuisance people’s people are! Try and make him come. By the\\nway, Dorian, you ran off very early last night. You left before eleven.\\nWhat did you do afterwards? Did you go straight home?”\\n\\nDorian glanced at him hurriedly and frowned.\\n\\n“No, Harry,” he said at last, “I did not get home till nearly three.”\\n\\n“Did you go to the club?”\\n\\n“Yes,” he answered. Then he bit his lip. “No, I don’t mean that. I\\ndidn’t go to the club. I walked about. I forget what I did.... How\\ninquisitive you are, Harry! You always want to know what one has been\\ndoing. I always want to forget what I have been doing. I came in at\\nhalf-past two, if you wish to know the exact time. I had left my\\nlatch-key at home, and my servant had to let me in. If you want any\\ncorroborative evidence on the subject, you can ask him.”\\n\\nLord Henry shrugged his shoulders. “My dear fellow, as if I cared! Let\\nus go up to the drawing-room. No sherry, thank you, Mr. Chapman.\\nSomething has happened to you, Dorian. Tell me what it is. You are not\\nyourself to-night.”\\n\\n“Don’t mind me, Harry. I am irritable, and out of temper. I shall come\\nround and see you to-morrow, or next day. Make my excuses to Lady\\nNarborough. I shan’t go upstairs. I shall go home. I must go home.”\\n\\n“All right, Dorian. I dare say I shall see you to-morrow at tea-time.\\nThe duchess is coming.”\\n\\n“I will try to be there, Harry,” he said, leaving the room. As he drove\\nback to his own house, he was conscious that the sense of terror he\\nthought he had strangled had come back to him. Lord Henry’s casual\\nquestioning had made him lose his nerve for the moment, and he wanted\\nhis nerve still. Things that were dangerous had to be destroyed. He\\nwinced. He hated the idea of even touching them.\\n\\nYet it had to be done. He realized that, and when he had locked the\\ndoor of his library, he opened the secret press into which he had\\nthrust Basil Hallward’s coat and bag. A huge fire was blazing. He piled\\nanother log on it. The smell of the singeing clothes and burning\\nleather was horrible. It took him three-quarters of an hour to consume\\neverything. At the end he felt faint and sick, and having lit some\\nAlgerian pastilles in a pierced copper brazier, he bathed his hands and\\nforehead with a cool musk-scented vinegar.\\n\\nSuddenly he started. His eyes grew strangely bright, and he gnawed\\nnervously at his underlip. Between two of the windows stood a large\\nFlorentine cabinet, made out of ebony and inlaid with ivory and blue\\nlapis. He watched it as though it were a thing that could fascinate and\\nmake afraid, as though it held something that he longed for and yet\\nalmost loathed. His breath quickened. A mad craving came over him. He\\nlit a cigarette and then threw it away. His eyelids drooped till the\\nlong fringed lashes almost touched his cheek. But he still watched the\\ncabinet. At last he got up from the sofa on which he had been lying,\\nwent over to it, and having unlocked it, touched some hidden spring. A\\ntriangular drawer passed slowly out. His fingers moved instinctively\\ntowards it, dipped in, and closed on something. It was a small Chinese\\nbox of black and gold-dust lacquer, elaborately wrought, the sides\\npatterned with curved waves, and the silken cords hung with round\\ncrystals and tasselled in plaited metal threads. He opened it. Inside\\nwas a green paste, waxy in lustre, the odour curiously heavy and\\npersistent.\\n\\nHe hesitated for some moments, with a strangely immobile smile upon his\\nface. Then shivering, though the atmosphere of the room was terribly\\nhot, he drew himself up and glanced at the clock. It was twenty minutes\\nto twelve. He put the box back, shutting the cabinet doors as he did\\nso, and went into his bedroom.\\n\\nAs midnight was striking bronze blows upon the dusky air, Dorian Gray,\\ndressed commonly, and with a muffler wrapped round his throat, crept\\nquietly out of his house. In Bond Street he found a hansom with a good\\nhorse. He hailed it and in a low voice gave the driver an address.\\n\\nThe man shook his head. “It is too far for me,” he muttered.\\n\\n“Here is a sovereign for you,” said Dorian. “You shall have another if\\nyou drive fast.”\\n\\n“All right, sir,” answered the man, “you will be there in an hour,” and\\nafter his fare had got in he turned his horse round and drove rapidly\\ntowards the river.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI.\\n\\n\\nA cold rain began to fall, and the blurred street-lamps looked ghastly\\nin the dripping mist. The public-houses were just closing, and dim men\\nand women were clustering in broken groups round their doors. From some\\nof the bars came the sound of horrible laughter. In others, drunkards\\nbrawled and screamed.\\n\\nLying back in the hansom, with his hat pulled over his forehead, Dorian\\nGray watched with listless eyes the sordid shame of the great city, and\\nnow and then he repeated to himself the words that Lord Henry had said\\nto him on the first day they had met, “To cure the soul by means of the\\nsenses, and the senses by means of the soul.” Yes, that was the secret.\\nHe had often tried it, and would try it again now. There were opium\\ndens where one could buy oblivion, dens of horror where the memory of\\nold sins could be destroyed by the madness of sins that were new.\\n\\nThe moon hung low in the sky like a yellow skull. From time to time a\\nhuge misshapen cloud stretched a long arm across and hid it. The\\ngas-lamps grew fewer, and the streets more narrow and gloomy. Once the\\nman lost his way and had to drive back half a mile. A steam rose from\\nthe horse as it splashed up the puddles. The sidewindows of the hansom\\nwere clogged with a grey-flannel mist.\\n\\n“To cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of\\nthe soul!” How the words rang in his ears! His soul, certainly, was\\nsick to death. Was it true that the senses could cure it? Innocent\\nblood had been spilled. What could atone for that? Ah! for that there\\nwas no atonement; but though forgiveness was impossible, forgetfulness\\nwas possible still, and he was determined to forget, to stamp the thing\\nout, to crush it as one would crush the adder that had stung one.\\nIndeed, what right had Basil to have spoken to him as he had done? Who\\nhad made him a judge over others? He had said things that were\\ndreadful, horrible, not to be endured.\\n\\nOn and on plodded the hansom, going slower, it seemed to him, at each\\nstep. He thrust up the trap and called to the man to drive faster. The\\nhideous hunger for opium began to gnaw at him. His throat burned and\\nhis delicate hands twitched nervously together. He struck at the horse\\nmadly with his stick. The driver laughed and whipped up. He laughed in\\nanswer, and the man was silent.\\n\\nThe way seemed interminable, and the streets like the black web of some\\nsprawling spider. The monotony became unbearable, and as the mist\\nthickened, he felt afraid.\\n\\nThen they passed by lonely brickfields. The fog was lighter here, and\\nhe could see the strange, bottle-shaped kilns with their orange,\\nfanlike tongues of fire. A dog barked as they went by, and far away in\\nthe darkness some wandering sea-gull screamed. The horse stumbled in a\\nrut, then swerved aside and broke into a gallop.\\n\\nAfter some time they left the clay road and rattled again over\\nrough-paven streets. Most of the windows were dark, but now and then\\nfantastic shadows were silhouetted against some lamplit blind. He\\nwatched them curiously. They moved like monstrous marionettes and made\\ngestures like live things. He hated them. A dull rage was in his heart.\\nAs they turned a corner, a woman yelled something at them from an open\\ndoor, and two men ran after the hansom for about a hundred yards. The\\ndriver beat at them with his whip.\\n\\nIt is said that passion makes one think in a circle. Certainly with\\nhideous iteration the bitten lips of Dorian Gray shaped and reshaped\\nthose subtle words that dealt with soul and sense, till he had found in\\nthem the full expression, as it were, of his mood, and justified, by\\nintellectual approval, passions that without such justification would\\nstill have dominated his temper. From cell to cell of his brain crept\\nthe one thought; and the wild desire to live, most terrible of all\\nman’s appetites, quickened into force each trembling nerve and fibre.\\nUgliness that had once been hateful to him because it made things real,\\nbecame dear to him now for that very reason. Ugliness was the one\\nreality. The coarse brawl, the loathsome den, the crude violence of\\ndisordered life, the very vileness of thief and outcast, were more\\nvivid, in their intense actuality of impression, than all the gracious\\nshapes of art, the dreamy shadows of song. They were what he needed for\\nforgetfulness. In three days he would be free.\\n\\nSuddenly the man drew up with a jerk at the top of a dark lane. Over\\nthe low roofs and jagged chimney-stacks of the houses rose the black\\nmasts of ships. Wreaths of white mist clung like ghostly sails to the\\nyards.\\n\\n“Somewhere about here, sir, ain’t it?” he asked huskily through the\\ntrap.\\n\\nDorian started and peered round. “This will do,” he answered, and\\nhaving got out hastily and given the driver the extra fare he had\\npromised him, he walked quickly in the direction of the quay. Here and\\nthere a lantern gleamed at the stern of some huge merchantman. The\\nlight shook and splintered in the puddles. A red glare came from an\\noutward-bound steamer that was coaling. The slimy pavement looked like\\na wet mackintosh.\\n\\nHe hurried on towards the left, glancing back now and then to see if he\\nwas being followed. In about seven or eight minutes he reached a small\\nshabby house that was wedged in between two gaunt factories. In one of\\nthe top-windows stood a lamp. He stopped and gave a peculiar knock.\\n\\nAfter a little time he heard steps in the passage and the chain being\\nunhooked. The door opened quietly, and he went in without saying a word\\nto the squat misshapen figure that flattened itself into the shadow as\\nhe passed. At the end of the hall hung a tattered green curtain that\\nswayed and shook in the gusty wind which had followed him in from the\\nstreet. He dragged it aside and entered a long low room which looked as\\nif it had once been a third-rate dancing-saloon. Shrill flaring\\ngas-jets, dulled and distorted in the fly-blown mirrors that faced\\nthem, were ranged round the walls. Greasy reflectors of ribbed tin\\nbacked them, making quivering disks of light. The floor was covered\\nwith ochre-coloured sawdust, trampled here and there into mud, and\\nstained with dark rings of spilled liquor. Some Malays were crouching\\nby a little charcoal stove, playing with bone counters and showing\\ntheir white teeth as they chattered. In one corner, with his head\\nburied in his arms, a sailor sprawled over a table, and by the tawdrily\\npainted bar that ran across one complete side stood two haggard women,\\nmocking an old man who was brushing the sleeves of his coat with an\\nexpression of disgust. “He thinks he’s got red ants on him,” laughed\\none of them, as Dorian passed by. The man looked at her in terror and\\nbegan to whimper.\\n\\nAt the end of the room there was a little staircase, leading to a\\ndarkened chamber. As Dorian hurried up its three rickety steps, the\\nheavy odour of opium met him. He heaved a deep breath, and his nostrils\\nquivered with pleasure. When he entered, a young man with smooth yellow\\nhair, who was bending over a lamp lighting a long thin pipe, looked up\\nat him and nodded in a hesitating manner.\\n\\n“You here, Adrian?” muttered Dorian.\\n\\n“Where else should I be?” he answered, listlessly. “None of the chaps\\nwill speak to me now.”\\n\\n“I thought you had left England.”\\n\\n“Darlington is not going to do anything. My brother paid the bill at\\nlast. George doesn’t speak to me either.... I don’t care,” he added\\nwith a sigh. “As long as one has this stuff, one doesn’t want friends.\\nI think I have had too many friends.”\\n\\nDorian winced and looked round at the grotesque things that lay in such\\nfantastic postures on the ragged mattresses. The twisted limbs, the\\ngaping mouths, the staring lustreless eyes, fascinated him. He knew in\\nwhat strange heavens they were suffering, and what dull hells were\\nteaching them the secret of some new joy. They were better off than he\\nwas. He was prisoned in thought. Memory, like a horrible malady, was\\neating his soul away. From time to time he seemed to see the eyes of\\nBasil Hallward looking at him. Yet he felt he could not stay. The\\npresence of Adrian Singleton troubled him. He wanted to be where no one\\nwould know who he was. He wanted to escape from himself.\\n\\n“I am going on to the other place,” he said after a pause.\\n\\n“On the wharf?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“That mad-cat is sure to be there. They won’t have her in this place\\nnow.”\\n\\nDorian shrugged his shoulders. “I am sick of women who love one. Women\\nwho hate one are much more interesting. Besides, the stuff is better.”\\n\\n“Much the same.”\\n\\n“I like it better. Come and have something to drink. I must have\\nsomething.”\\n\\n“I don’t want anything,” murmured the young man.\\n\\n“Never mind.”\\n\\nAdrian Singleton rose up wearily and followed Dorian to the bar. A\\nhalf-caste, in a ragged turban and a shabby ulster, grinned a hideous\\ngreeting as he thrust a bottle of brandy and two tumblers in front of\\nthem. The women sidled up and began to chatter. Dorian turned his back\\non them and said something in a low voice to Adrian Singleton.\\n\\nA crooked smile, like a Malay crease, writhed across the face of one of\\nthe women. “We are very proud to-night,” she sneered.\\n\\n“For God’s sake don’t talk to me,” cried Dorian, stamping his foot on\\nthe ground. “What do you want? Money? Here it is. Don’t ever talk to me\\nagain.”\\n\\nTwo red sparks flashed for a moment in the woman’s sodden eyes, then\\nflickered out and left them dull and glazed. She tossed her head and\\nraked the coins off the counter with greedy fingers. Her companion\\nwatched her enviously.\\n\\n“It’s no use,” sighed Adrian Singleton. “I don’t care to go back. What\\ndoes it matter? I am quite happy here.”\\n\\n“You will write to me if you want anything, won’t you?” said Dorian,\\nafter a pause.\\n\\n“Perhaps.”\\n\\n“Good night, then.”\\n\\n“Good night,” answered the young man, passing up the steps and wiping\\nhis parched mouth with a handkerchief.\\n\\nDorian walked to the door with a look of pain in his face. As he drew\\nthe curtain aside, a hideous laugh broke from the painted lips of the\\nwoman who had taken his money. “There goes the devil’s bargain!” she\\nhiccoughed, in a hoarse voice.\\n\\n“Curse you!” he answered, “don’t call me that.”\\n\\nShe snapped her fingers. “Prince Charming is what you like to be\\ncalled, ain’t it?” she yelled after him.\\n\\nThe drowsy sailor leaped to his feet as she spoke, and looked wildly\\nround. The sound of the shutting of the hall door fell on his ear. He\\nrushed out as if in pursuit.\\n\\nDorian Gray hurried along the quay through the drizzling rain. His\\nmeeting with Adrian Singleton had strangely moved him, and he wondered\\nif the ruin of that young life was really to be laid at his door, as\\nBasil Hallward had said to him with such infamy of insult. He bit his\\nlip, and for a few seconds his eyes grew sad. Yet, after all, what did\\nit matter to him? One’s days were too brief to take the burden of\\nanother’s errors on one’s shoulders. Each man lived his own life and\\npaid his own price for living it. The only pity was one had to pay so\\noften for a single fault. One had to pay over and over again, indeed.\\nIn her dealings with man, destiny never closed her accounts.\\n\\nThere are moments, psychologists tell us, when the passion for sin, or\\nfor what the world calls sin, so dominates a nature that every fibre of\\nthe body, as every cell of the brain, seems to be instinct with fearful\\nimpulses. Men and women at such moments lose the freedom of their will.\\nThey move to their terrible end as automatons move. Choice is taken\\nfrom them, and conscience is either killed, or, if it lives at all,\\nlives but to give rebellion its fascination and disobedience its charm.\\nFor all sins, as theologians weary not of reminding us, are sins of\\ndisobedience. When that high spirit, that morning star of evil, fell\\nfrom heaven, it was as a rebel that he fell.\\n\\nCallous, concentrated on evil, with stained mind, and soul hungry for\\nrebellion, Dorian Gray hastened on, quickening his step as he went, but\\nas he darted aside into a dim archway, that had served him often as a\\nshort cut to the ill-famed place where he was going, he felt himself\\nsuddenly seized from behind, and before he had time to defend himself,\\nhe was thrust back against the wall, with a brutal hand round his\\nthroat.\\n\\nHe struggled madly for life, and by a terrible effort wrenched the\\ntightening fingers away. In a second he heard the click of a revolver,\\nand saw the gleam of a polished barrel, pointing straight at his head,\\nand the dusky form of a short, thick-set man facing him.\\n\\n“What do you want?” he gasped.\\n\\n“Keep quiet,” said the man. “If you stir, I shoot you.”\\n\\n“You are mad. What have I done to you?”\\n\\n“You wrecked the life of Sibyl Vane,” was the answer, “and Sibyl Vane\\nwas my sister. She killed herself. I know it. Her death is at your\\ndoor. I swore I would kill you in return. For years I have sought you.\\nI had no clue, no trace. The two people who could have described you\\nwere dead. I knew nothing of you but the pet name she used to call you.\\nI heard it to-night by chance. Make your peace with God, for to-night\\nyou are going to die.”\\n\\nDorian Gray grew sick with fear. “I never knew her,” he stammered. “I\\nnever heard of her. You are mad.”\\n\\n“You had better confess your sin, for as sure as I am James Vane, you\\nare going to die.” There was a horrible moment. Dorian did not know\\nwhat to say or do. “Down on your knees!” growled the man. “I give you\\none minute to make your peace—no more. I go on board to-night for\\nIndia, and I must do my job first. One minute. That’s all.”\\n\\nDorian’s arms fell to his side. Paralysed with terror, he did not know\\nwhat to do. Suddenly a wild hope flashed across his brain. “Stop,” he\\ncried. “How long ago is it since your sister died? Quick, tell me!”\\n\\n“Eighteen years,” said the man. “Why do you ask me? What do years\\nmatter?”\\n\\n“Eighteen years,” laughed Dorian Gray, with a touch of triumph in his\\nvoice. “Eighteen years! Set me under the lamp and look at my face!”\\n\\nJames Vane hesitated for a moment, not understanding what was meant.\\nThen he seized Dorian Gray and dragged him from the archway.\\n\\nDim and wavering as was the wind-blown light, yet it served to show him\\nthe hideous error, as it seemed, into which he had fallen, for the face\\nof the man he had sought to kill had all the bloom of boyhood, all the\\nunstained purity of youth. He seemed little more than a lad of twenty\\nsummers, hardly older, if older indeed at all, than his sister had been\\nwhen they had parted so many years ago. It was obvious that this was\\nnot the man who had destroyed her life.\\n\\nHe loosened his hold and reeled back. “My God! my God!” he cried, “and\\nI would have murdered you!”\\n\\nDorian Gray drew a long breath. “You have been on the brink of\\ncommitting a terrible crime, my man,” he said, looking at him sternly.\\n“Let this be a warning to you not to take vengeance into your own\\nhands.”\\n\\n“Forgive me, sir,” muttered James Vane. “I was deceived. A chance word\\nI heard in that damned den set me on the wrong track.”\\n\\n“You had better go home and put that pistol away, or you may get into\\ntrouble,” said Dorian, turning on his heel and going slowly down the\\nstreet.\\n\\nJames Vane stood on the pavement in horror. He was trembling from head\\nto foot. After a little while, a black shadow that had been creeping\\nalong the dripping wall moved out into the light and came close to him\\nwith stealthy footsteps. He felt a hand laid on his arm and looked\\nround with a start. It was one of the women who had been drinking at\\nthe bar.\\n\\n“Why didn’t you kill him?” she hissed out, putting haggard face quite\\nclose to his. “I knew you were following him when you rushed out from\\nDaly’s. You fool! You should have killed him. He has lots of money, and\\nhe’s as bad as bad.”\\n\\n“He is not the man I am looking for,” he answered, “and I want no man’s\\nmoney. I want a man’s life. The man whose life I want must be nearly\\nforty now. This one is little more than a boy. Thank God, I have not\\ngot his blood upon my hands.”\\n\\nThe woman gave a bitter laugh. “Little more than a boy!” she sneered.\\n“Why, man, it’s nigh on eighteen years since Prince Charming made me\\nwhat I am.”\\n\\n“You lie!” cried James Vane.\\n\\nShe raised her hand up to heaven. “Before God I am telling the truth,”\\nshe cried.\\n\\n“Before God?”\\n\\n“Strike me dumb if it ain’t so. He is the worst one that comes here.\\nThey say he has sold himself to the devil for a pretty face. It’s nigh\\non eighteen years since I met him. He hasn’t changed much since then. I\\nhave, though,” she added, with a sickly leer.\\n\\n“You swear this?”\\n\\n“I swear it,” came in hoarse echo from her flat mouth. “But don’t give\\nme away to him,” she whined; “I am afraid of him. Let me have some\\nmoney for my night’s lodging.”\\n\\nHe broke from her with an oath and rushed to the corner of the street,\\nbut Dorian Gray had disappeared. When he looked back, the woman had\\nvanished also.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII.\\n\\n\\nA week later Dorian Gray was sitting in the conservatory at Selby\\nRoyal, talking to the pretty Duchess of Monmouth, who with her husband,\\na jaded-looking man of sixty, was amongst his guests. It was tea-time,\\nand the mellow light of the huge, lace-covered lamp that stood on the\\ntable lit up the delicate china and hammered silver of the service at\\nwhich the duchess was presiding. Her white hands were moving daintily\\namong the cups, and her full red lips were smiling at something that\\nDorian had whispered to her. Lord Henry was lying back in a silk-draped\\nwicker chair, looking at them. On a peach-coloured divan sat Lady\\nNarborough, pretending to listen to the duke’s description of the last\\nBrazilian beetle that he had added to his collection. Three young men\\nin elaborate smoking-suits were handing tea-cakes to some of the women.\\nThe house-party consisted of twelve people, and there were more\\nexpected to arrive on the next day.\\n\\n“What are you two talking about?” said Lord Henry, strolling over to\\nthe table and putting his cup down. “I hope Dorian has told you about\\nmy plan for rechristening everything, Gladys. It is a delightful idea.”\\n\\n“But I don’t want to be rechristened, Harry,” rejoined the duchess,\\nlooking up at him with her wonderful eyes. “I am quite satisfied with\\nmy own name, and I am sure Mr. Gray should be satisfied with his.”\\n\\n“My dear Gladys, I would not alter either name for the world. They are\\nboth perfect. I was thinking chiefly of flowers. Yesterday I cut an\\norchid, for my button-hole. It was a marvellous spotted thing, as\\neffective as the seven deadly sins. In a thoughtless moment I asked one\\nof the gardeners what it was called. He told me it was a fine specimen\\nof _Robinsoniana_, or something dreadful of that kind. It is a sad\\ntruth, but we have lost the faculty of giving lovely names to things.\\nNames are everything. I never quarrel with actions. My one quarrel is\\nwith words. That is the reason I hate vulgar realism in literature. The\\nman who could call a spade a spade should be compelled to use one. It\\nis the only thing he is fit for.”\\n\\n“Then what should we call you, Harry?” she asked.\\n\\n“His name is Prince Paradox,” said Dorian.\\n\\n“I recognize him in a flash,” exclaimed the duchess.\\n\\n“I won’t hear of it,” laughed Lord Henry, sinking into a chair. “From a\\nlabel there is no escape! I refuse the title.”\\n\\n“Royalties may not abdicate,” fell as a warning from pretty lips.\\n\\n“You wish me to defend my throne, then?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“I give the truths of to-morrow.”\\n\\n“I prefer the mistakes of to-day,” she answered.\\n\\n“You disarm me, Gladys,” he cried, catching the wilfulness of her mood.\\n\\n“Of your shield, Harry, not of your spear.”\\n\\n“I never tilt against beauty,” he said, with a wave of his hand.\\n\\n“That is your error, Harry, believe me. You value beauty far too much.”\\n\\n“How can you say that? I admit that I think that it is better to be\\nbeautiful than to be good. But on the other hand, no one is more ready\\nthan I am to acknowledge that it is better to be good than to be ugly.”\\n\\n“Ugliness is one of the seven deadly sins, then?” cried the duchess.\\n“What becomes of your simile about the orchid?”\\n\\n“Ugliness is one of the seven deadly virtues, Gladys. You, as a good\\nTory, must not underrate them. Beer, the Bible, and the seven deadly\\nvirtues have made our England what she is.”\\n\\n“You don’t like your country, then?” she asked.\\n\\n“I live in it.”\\n\\n“That you may censure it the better.”\\n\\n“Would you have me take the verdict of Europe on it?” he inquired.\\n\\n“What do they say of us?”\\n\\n“That Tartuffe has emigrated to England and opened a shop.”\\n\\n“Is that yours, Harry?”\\n\\n“I give it to you.”\\n\\n“I could not use it. It is too true.”\\n\\n“You need not be afraid. Our countrymen never recognize a description.”\\n\\n“They are practical.”\\n\\n“They are more cunning than practical. When they make up their ledger,\\nthey balance stupidity by wealth, and vice by hypocrisy.”\\n\\n“Still, we have done great things.”\\n\\n“Great things have been thrust on us, Gladys.”\\n\\n“We have carried their burden.”\\n\\n“Only as far as the Stock Exchange.”\\n\\nShe shook her head. “I believe in the race,” she cried.\\n\\n“It represents the survival of the pushing.”\\n\\n“It has development.”\\n\\n“Decay fascinates me more.”\\n\\n“What of art?” she asked.\\n\\n“It is a malady.”\\n\\n“Love?”\\n\\n“An illusion.”\\n\\n“Religion?”\\n\\n“The fashionable substitute for belief.”\\n\\n“You are a sceptic.”\\n\\n“Never! Scepticism is the beginning of faith.”\\n\\n“What are you?”\\n\\n“To define is to limit.”\\n\\n“Give me a clue.”\\n\\n“Threads snap. You would lose your way in the labyrinth.”\\n\\n“You bewilder me. Let us talk of some one else.”\\n\\n“Our host is a delightful topic. Years ago he was christened Prince\\nCharming.”\\n\\n“Ah! don’t remind me of that,” cried Dorian Gray.\\n\\n“Our host is rather horrid this evening,” answered the duchess,\\ncolouring. “I believe he thinks that Monmouth married me on purely\\nscientific principles as the best specimen he could find of a modern\\nbutterfly.”\\n\\n“Well, I hope he won’t stick pins into you, Duchess,” laughed Dorian.\\n\\n“Oh! my maid does that already, Mr. Gray, when she is annoyed with me.”\\n\\n“And what does she get annoyed with you about, Duchess?”\\n\\n“For the most trivial things, Mr. Gray, I assure you. Usually because I\\ncome in at ten minutes to nine and tell her that I must be dressed by\\nhalf-past eight.”\\n\\n“How unreasonable of her! You should give her warning.”\\n\\n“I daren’t, Mr. Gray. Why, she invents hats for me. You remember the\\none I wore at Lady Hilstone’s garden-party? You don’t, but it is nice\\nof you to pretend that you do. Well, she made it out of nothing. All\\ngood hats are made out of nothing.”\\n\\n“Like all good reputations, Gladys,” interrupted Lord Henry. “Every\\neffect that one produces gives one an enemy. To be popular one must be\\na mediocrity.”\\n\\n“Not with women,” said the duchess, shaking her head; “and women rule\\nthe world. I assure you we can’t bear mediocrities. We women, as some\\none says, love with our ears, just as you men love with your eyes, if\\nyou ever love at all.”\\n\\n“It seems to me that we never do anything else,” murmured Dorian.\\n\\n“Ah! then, you never really love, Mr. Gray,” answered the duchess with\\nmock sadness.\\n\\n“My dear Gladys!” cried Lord Henry. “How can you say that? Romance\\nlives by repetition, and repetition converts an appetite into an art.\\nBesides, each time that one loves is the only time one has ever loved.\\nDifference of object does not alter singleness of passion. It merely\\nintensifies it. We can have in life but one great experience at best,\\nand the secret of life is to reproduce that experience as often as\\npossible.”\\n\\n“Even when one has been wounded by it, Harry?” asked the duchess after\\na pause.\\n\\n“Especially when one has been wounded by it,” answered Lord Henry.\\n\\nThe duchess turned and looked at Dorian Gray with a curious expression\\nin her eyes. “What do you say to that, Mr. Gray?” she inquired.\\n\\nDorian hesitated for a moment. Then he threw his head back and laughed.\\n“I always agree with Harry, Duchess.”\\n\\n“Even when he is wrong?”\\n\\n“Harry is never wrong, Duchess.”\\n\\n“And does his philosophy make you happy?”\\n\\n“I have never searched for happiness. Who wants happiness? I have\\nsearched for pleasure.”\\n\\n“And found it, Mr. Gray?”\\n\\n“Often. Too often.”\\n\\nThe duchess sighed. “I am searching for peace,” she said, “and if I\\ndon’t go and dress, I shall have none this evening.”\\n\\n“Let me get you some orchids, Duchess,” cried Dorian, starting to his\\nfeet and walking down the conservatory.\\n\\n“You are flirting disgracefully with him,” said Lord Henry to his\\ncousin. “You had better take care. He is very fascinating.”\\n\\n“If he were not, there would be no battle.”\\n\\n“Greek meets Greek, then?”\\n\\n“I am on the side of the Trojans. They fought for a woman.”\\n\\n“They were defeated.”\\n\\n“There are worse things than capture,” she answered.\\n\\n“You gallop with a loose rein.”\\n\\n“Pace gives life,” was the _riposte_.\\n\\n“I shall write it in my diary to-night.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“That a burnt child loves the fire.”\\n\\n“I am not even singed. My wings are untouched.”\\n\\n“You use them for everything, except flight.”\\n\\n“Courage has passed from men to women. It is a new experience for us.”\\n\\n“You have a rival.”\\n\\n“Who?”\\n\\nHe laughed. “Lady Narborough,” he whispered. “She perfectly adores\\nhim.”\\n\\n“You fill me with apprehension. The appeal to antiquity is fatal to us\\nwho are romanticists.”\\n\\n“Romanticists! You have all the methods of science.”\\n\\n“Men have educated us.”\\n\\n“But not explained you.”\\n\\n“Describe us as a sex,” was her challenge.\\n\\n“Sphinxes without secrets.”\\n\\nShe looked at him, smiling. “How long Mr. Gray is!” she said. “Let us\\ngo and help him. I have not yet told him the colour of my frock.”\\n\\n“Ah! you must suit your frock to his flowers, Gladys.”\\n\\n“That would be a premature surrender.”\\n\\n“Romantic art begins with its climax.”\\n\\n“I must keep an opportunity for retreat.”\\n\\n“In the Parthian manner?”\\n\\n“They found safety in the desert. I could not do that.”\\n\\n“Women are not always allowed a choice,” he answered, but hardly had he\\nfinished the sentence before from the far end of the conservatory came\\na stifled groan, followed by the dull sound of a heavy fall. Everybody\\nstarted up. The duchess stood motionless in horror. And with fear in\\nhis eyes, Lord Henry rushed through the flapping palms to find Dorian\\nGray lying face downwards on the tiled floor in a deathlike swoon.\\n\\nHe was carried at once into the blue drawing-room and laid upon one of\\nthe sofas. After a short time, he came to himself and looked round with\\na dazed expression.\\n\\n“What has happened?” he asked. “Oh! I remember. Am I safe here, Harry?”\\nHe began to tremble.\\n\\n“My dear Dorian,” answered Lord Henry, “you merely fainted. That was\\nall. You must have overtired yourself. You had better not come down to\\ndinner. I will take your place.”\\n\\n“No, I will come down,” he said, struggling to his feet. “I would\\nrather come down. I must not be alone.”\\n\\nHe went to his room and dressed. There was a wild recklessness of\\ngaiety in his manner as he sat at table, but now and then a thrill of\\nterror ran through him when he remembered that, pressed against the\\nwindow of the conservatory, like a white handkerchief, he had seen the\\nface of James Vane watching him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII.\\n\\n\\nThe next day he did not leave the house, and, indeed, spent most of the\\ntime in his own room, sick with a wild terror of dying, and yet\\nindifferent to life itself. The consciousness of being hunted, snared,\\ntracked down, had begun to dominate him. If the tapestry did but\\ntremble in the wind, he shook. The dead leaves that were blown against\\nthe leaded panes seemed to him like his own wasted resolutions and wild\\nregrets. When he closed his eyes, he saw again the sailor’s face\\npeering through the mist-stained glass, and horror seemed once more to\\nlay its hand upon his heart.\\n\\nBut perhaps it had been only his fancy that had called vengeance out of\\nthe night and set the hideous shapes of punishment before him. Actual\\nlife was chaos, but there was something terribly logical in the\\nimagination. It was the imagination that set remorse to dog the feet of\\nsin. It was the imagination that made each crime bear its misshapen\\nbrood. In the common world of fact the wicked were not punished, nor\\nthe good rewarded. Success was given to the strong, failure thrust upon\\nthe weak. That was all. Besides, had any stranger been prowling round\\nthe house, he would have been seen by the servants or the keepers. Had\\nany foot-marks been found on the flower-beds, the gardeners would have\\nreported it. Yes, it had been merely fancy. Sibyl Vane’s brother had\\nnot come back to kill him. He had sailed away in his ship to founder in\\nsome winter sea. From him, at any rate, he was safe. Why, the man did\\nnot know who he was, could not know who he was. The mask of youth had\\nsaved him.\\n\\nAnd yet if it had been merely an illusion, how terrible it was to think\\nthat conscience could raise such fearful phantoms, and give them\\nvisible form, and make them move before one! What sort of life would\\nhis be if, day and night, shadows of his crime were to peer at him from\\nsilent corners, to mock him from secret places, to whisper in his ear\\nas he sat at the feast, to wake him with icy fingers as he lay asleep!\\nAs the thought crept through his brain, he grew pale with terror, and\\nthe air seemed to him to have become suddenly colder. Oh! in what a\\nwild hour of madness he had killed his friend! How ghastly the mere\\nmemory of the scene! He saw it all again. Each hideous detail came back\\nto him with added horror. Out of the black cave of time, terrible and\\nswathed in scarlet, rose the image of his sin. When Lord Henry came in\\nat six o’clock, he found him crying as one whose heart will break.\\n\\nIt was not till the third day that he ventured to go out. There was\\nsomething in the clear, pine-scented air of that winter morning that\\nseemed to bring him back his joyousness and his ardour for life. But it\\nwas not merely the physical conditions of environment that had caused\\nthe change. His own nature had revolted against the excess of anguish\\nthat had sought to maim and mar the perfection of its calm. With subtle\\nand finely wrought temperaments it is always so. Their strong passions\\nmust either bruise or bend. They either slay the man, or themselves\\ndie. Shallow sorrows and shallow loves live on. The loves and sorrows\\nthat are great are destroyed by their own plenitude. Besides, he had\\nconvinced himself that he had been the victim of a terror-stricken\\nimagination, and looked back now on his fears with something of pity\\nand not a little of contempt.\\n\\nAfter breakfast, he walked with the duchess for an hour in the garden\\nand then drove across the park to join the shooting-party. The crisp\\nfrost lay like salt upon the grass. The sky was an inverted cup of blue\\nmetal. A thin film of ice bordered the flat, reed-grown lake.\\n\\nAt the corner of the pine-wood he caught sight of Sir Geoffrey\\nClouston, the duchess’s brother, jerking two spent cartridges out of\\nhis gun. He jumped from the cart, and having told the groom to take the\\nmare home, made his way towards his guest through the withered bracken\\nand rough undergrowth.\\n\\n“Have you had good sport, Geoffrey?” he asked.\\n\\n“Not very good, Dorian. I think most of the birds have gone to the\\nopen. I dare say it will be better after lunch, when we get to new\\nground.”\\n\\nDorian strolled along by his side. The keen aromatic air, the brown and\\nred lights that glimmered in the wood, the hoarse cries of the beaters\\nringing out from time to time, and the sharp snaps of the guns that\\nfollowed, fascinated him and filled him with a sense of delightful\\nfreedom. He was dominated by the carelessness of happiness, by the high\\nindifference of joy.\\n\\nSuddenly from a lumpy tussock of old grass some twenty yards in front\\nof them, with black-tipped ears erect and long hinder limbs throwing it\\nforward, started a hare. It bolted for a thicket of alders. Sir\\nGeoffrey put his gun to his shoulder, but there was something in the\\nanimal’s grace of movement that strangely charmed Dorian Gray, and he\\ncried out at once, “Don’t shoot it, Geoffrey. Let it live.”\\n\\n“What nonsense, Dorian!” laughed his companion, and as the hare bounded\\ninto the thicket, he fired. There were two cries heard, the cry of a\\nhare in pain, which is dreadful, the cry of a man in agony, which is\\nworse.\\n\\n“Good heavens! I have hit a beater!” exclaimed Sir Geoffrey. “What an\\nass the man was to get in front of the guns! Stop shooting there!” he\\ncalled out at the top of his voice. “A man is hurt.”\\n\\nThe head-keeper came running up with a stick in his hand.\\n\\n“Where, sir? Where is he?” he shouted. At the same time, the firing\\nceased along the line.\\n\\n“Here,” answered Sir Geoffrey angrily, hurrying towards the thicket.\\n“Why on earth don’t you keep your men back? Spoiled my shooting for the\\nday.”\\n\\nDorian watched them as they plunged into the alder-clump, brushing the\\nlithe swinging branches aside. In a few moments they emerged, dragging\\na body after them into the sunlight. He turned away in horror. It\\nseemed to him that misfortune followed wherever he went. He heard Sir\\nGeoffrey ask if the man was really dead, and the affirmative answer of\\nthe keeper. The wood seemed to him to have become suddenly alive with\\nfaces. There was the trampling of myriad feet and the low buzz of\\nvoices. A great copper-breasted pheasant came beating through the\\nboughs overhead.\\n\\nAfter a few moments—that were to him, in his perturbed state, like\\nendless hours of pain—he felt a hand laid on his shoulder. He started\\nand looked round.\\n\\n“Dorian,” said Lord Henry, “I had better tell them that the shooting is\\nstopped for to-day. It would not look well to go on.”\\n\\n“I wish it were stopped for ever, Harry,” he answered bitterly. “The\\nwhole thing is hideous and cruel. Is the man ...?”\\n\\nHe could not finish the sentence.\\n\\n“I am afraid so,” rejoined Lord Henry. “He got the whole charge of shot\\nin his chest. He must have died almost instantaneously. Come; let us go\\nhome.”\\n\\nThey walked side by side in the direction of the avenue for nearly\\nfifty yards without speaking. Then Dorian looked at Lord Henry and\\nsaid, with a heavy sigh, “It is a bad omen, Harry, a very bad omen.”\\n\\n“What is?” asked Lord Henry. “Oh! this accident, I suppose. My dear\\nfellow, it can’t be helped. It was the man’s own fault. Why did he get\\nin front of the guns? Besides, it is nothing to us. It is rather\\nawkward for Geoffrey, of course. It does not do to pepper beaters. It\\nmakes people think that one is a wild shot. And Geoffrey is not; he\\nshoots very straight. But there is no use talking about the matter.”\\n\\nDorian shook his head. “It is a bad omen, Harry. I feel as if something\\nhorrible were going to happen to some of us. To myself, perhaps,” he\\nadded, passing his hand over his eyes, with a gesture of pain.\\n\\nThe elder man laughed. “The only horrible thing in the world is\\n_ennui_, Dorian. That is the one sin for which there is no forgiveness.\\nBut we are not likely to suffer from it unless these fellows keep\\nchattering about this thing at dinner. I must tell them that the\\nsubject is to be tabooed. As for omens, there is no such thing as an\\nomen. Destiny does not send us heralds. She is too wise or too cruel\\nfor that. Besides, what on earth could happen to you, Dorian? You have\\neverything in the world that a man can want. There is no one who would\\nnot be delighted to change places with you.”\\n\\n“There is no one with whom I would not change places, Harry. Don’t\\nlaugh like that. I am telling you the truth. The wretched peasant who\\nhas just died is better off than I am. I have no terror of death. It is\\nthe coming of death that terrifies me. Its monstrous wings seem to\\nwheel in the leaden air around me. Good heavens! don’t you see a man\\nmoving behind the trees there, watching me, waiting for me?”\\n\\nLord Henry looked in the direction in which the trembling gloved hand\\nwas pointing. “Yes,” he said, smiling, “I see the gardener waiting for\\nyou. I suppose he wants to ask you what flowers you wish to have on the\\ntable to-night. How absurdly nervous you are, my dear fellow! You must\\ncome and see my doctor, when we get back to town.”\\n\\nDorian heaved a sigh of relief as he saw the gardener approaching. The\\nman touched his hat, glanced for a moment at Lord Henry in a hesitating\\nmanner, and then produced a letter, which he handed to his master. “Her\\nGrace told me to wait for an answer,” he murmured.\\n\\nDorian put the letter into his pocket. “Tell her Grace that I am coming\\nin,” he said, coldly. The man turned round and went rapidly in the\\ndirection of the house.\\n\\n“How fond women are of doing dangerous things!” laughed Lord Henry. “It\\nis one of the qualities in them that I admire most. A woman will flirt\\nwith anybody in the world as long as other people are looking on.”\\n\\n“How fond you are of saying dangerous things, Harry! In the present\\ninstance, you are quite astray. I like the duchess very much, but I\\ndon’t love her.”\\n\\n“And the duchess loves you very much, but she likes you less, so you\\nare excellently matched.”\\n\\n“You are talking scandal, Harry, and there is never any basis for\\nscandal.”\\n\\n“The basis of every scandal is an immoral certainty,” said Lord Henry,\\nlighting a cigarette.\\n\\n“You would sacrifice anybody, Harry, for the sake of an epigram.”\\n\\n“The world goes to the altar of its own accord,” was the answer.\\n\\n“I wish I could love,” cried Dorian Gray with a deep note of pathos in\\nhis voice. “But I seem to have lost the passion and forgotten the\\ndesire. I am too much concentrated on myself. My own personality has\\nbecome a burden to me. I want to escape, to go away, to forget. It was\\nsilly of me to come down here at all. I think I shall send a wire to\\nHarvey to have the yacht got ready. On a yacht one is safe.”\\n\\n“Safe from what, Dorian? You are in some trouble. Why not tell me what\\nit is? You know I would help you.”\\n\\n“I can’t tell you, Harry,” he answered sadly. “And I dare say it is\\nonly a fancy of mine. This unfortunate accident has upset me. I have a\\nhorrible presentiment that something of the kind may happen to me.”\\n\\n“What nonsense!”\\n\\n“I hope it is, but I can’t help feeling it. Ah! here is the duchess,\\nlooking like Artemis in a tailor-made gown. You see we have come back,\\nDuchess.”\\n\\n“I have heard all about it, Mr. Gray,” she answered. “Poor Geoffrey is\\nterribly upset. And it seems that you asked him not to shoot the hare.\\nHow curious!”\\n\\n“Yes, it was very curious. I don’t know what made me say it. Some whim,\\nI suppose. It looked the loveliest of little live things. But I am\\nsorry they told you about the man. It is a hideous subject.”\\n\\n“It is an annoying subject,” broke in Lord Henry. “It has no\\npsychological value at all. Now if Geoffrey had done the thing on\\npurpose, how interesting he would be! I should like to know some one\\nwho had committed a real murder.”\\n\\n“How horrid of you, Harry!” cried the duchess. “Isn’t it, Mr. Gray?\\nHarry, Mr. Gray is ill again. He is going to faint.”\\n\\nDorian drew himself up with an effort and smiled. “It is nothing,\\nDuchess,” he murmured; “my nerves are dreadfully out of order. That is\\nall. I am afraid I walked too far this morning. I didn’t hear what\\nHarry said. Was it very bad? You must tell me some other time. I think\\nI must go and lie down. You will excuse me, won’t you?”\\n\\nThey had reached the great flight of steps that led from the\\nconservatory on to the terrace. As the glass door closed behind Dorian,\\nLord Henry turned and looked at the duchess with his slumberous eyes.\\n“Are you very much in love with him?” he asked.\\n\\nShe did not answer for some time, but stood gazing at the landscape. “I\\nwish I knew,” she said at last.\\n\\nHe shook his head. “Knowledge would be fatal. It is the uncertainty\\nthat charms one. A mist makes things wonderful.”\\n\\n“One may lose one’s way.”\\n\\n“All ways end at the same point, my dear Gladys.”\\n\\n“What is that?”\\n\\n“Disillusion.”\\n\\n“It was my _début_ in life,” she sighed.\\n\\n“It came to you crowned.”\\n\\n“I am tired of strawberry leaves.”\\n\\n“They become you.”\\n\\n“Only in public.”\\n\\n“You would miss them,” said Lord Henry.\\n\\n“I will not part with a petal.”\\n\\n“Monmouth has ears.”\\n\\n“Old age is dull of hearing.”\\n\\n“Has he never been jealous?”\\n\\n“I wish he had been.”\\n\\nHe glanced about as if in search of something. “What are you looking\\nfor?” she inquired.\\n\\n“The button from your foil,” he answered. “You have dropped it.”\\n\\nShe laughed. “I have still the mask.”\\n\\n“It makes your eyes lovelier,” was his reply.\\n\\nShe laughed again. Her teeth showed like white seeds in a scarlet\\nfruit.\\n\\nUpstairs, in his own room, Dorian Gray was lying on a sofa, with terror\\nin every tingling fibre of his body. Life had suddenly become too\\nhideous a burden for him to bear. The dreadful death of the unlucky\\nbeater, shot in the thicket like a wild animal, had seemed to him to\\npre-figure death for himself also. He had nearly swooned at what Lord\\nHenry had said in a chance mood of cynical jesting.\\n\\nAt five o’clock he rang his bell for his servant and gave him orders to\\npack his things for the night-express to town, and to have the brougham\\nat the door by eight-thirty. He was determined not to sleep another\\nnight at Selby Royal. It was an ill-omened place. Death walked there in\\nthe sunlight. The grass of the forest had been spotted with blood.\\n\\nThen he wrote a note to Lord Henry, telling him that he was going up to\\ntown to consult his doctor and asking him to entertain his guests in\\nhis absence. As he was putting it into the envelope, a knock came to\\nthe door, and his valet informed him that the head-keeper wished to see\\nhim. He frowned and bit his lip. “Send him in,” he muttered, after some\\nmoments’ hesitation.\\n\\nAs soon as the man entered, Dorian pulled his chequebook out of a\\ndrawer and spread it out before him.\\n\\n“I suppose you have come about the unfortunate accident of this\\nmorning, Thornton?” he said, taking up a pen.\\n\\n“Yes, sir,” answered the gamekeeper.\\n\\n“Was the poor fellow married? Had he any people dependent on him?”\\nasked Dorian, looking bored. “If so, I should not like them to be left\\nin want, and will send them any sum of money you may think necessary.”\\n\\n“We don’t know who he is, sir. That is what I took the liberty of\\ncoming to you about.”\\n\\n“Don’t know who he is?” said Dorian, listlessly. “What do you mean?\\nWasn’t he one of your men?”\\n\\n“No, sir. Never saw him before. Seems like a sailor, sir.”\\n\\nThe pen dropped from Dorian Gray’s hand, and he felt as if his heart\\nhad suddenly stopped beating. “A sailor?” he cried out. “Did you say a\\nsailor?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir. He looks as if he had been a sort of sailor; tattooed on\\nboth arms, and that kind of thing.”\\n\\n“Was there anything found on him?” said Dorian, leaning forward and\\nlooking at the man with startled eyes. “Anything that would tell his\\nname?”\\n\\n“Some money, sir—not much, and a six-shooter. There was no name of any\\nkind. A decent-looking man, sir, but rough-like. A sort of sailor we\\nthink.”\\n\\nDorian started to his feet. A terrible hope fluttered past him. He\\nclutched at it madly. “Where is the body?” he exclaimed. “Quick! I must\\nsee it at once.”\\n\\n“It is in an empty stable in the Home Farm, sir. The folk don’t like to\\nhave that sort of thing in their houses. They say a corpse brings bad\\nluck.”\\n\\n“The Home Farm! Go there at once and meet me. Tell one of the grooms to\\nbring my horse round. No. Never mind. I’ll go to the stables myself. It\\nwill save time.”\\n\\nIn less than a quarter of an hour, Dorian Gray was galloping down the\\nlong avenue as hard as he could go. The trees seemed to sweep past him\\nin spectral procession, and wild shadows to fling themselves across his\\npath. Once the mare swerved at a white gate-post and nearly threw him.\\nHe lashed her across the neck with his crop. She cleft the dusky air\\nlike an arrow. The stones flew from her hoofs.\\n\\nAt last he reached the Home Farm. Two men were loitering in the yard.\\nHe leaped from the saddle and threw the reins to one of them. In the\\nfarthest stable a light was glimmering. Something seemed to tell him\\nthat the body was there, and he hurried to the door and put his hand\\nupon the latch.\\n\\nThere he paused for a moment, feeling that he was on the brink of a\\ndiscovery that would either make or mar his life. Then he thrust the\\ndoor open and entered.\\n\\nOn a heap of sacking in the far corner was lying the dead body of a man\\ndressed in a coarse shirt and a pair of blue trousers. A spotted\\nhandkerchief had been placed over the face. A coarse candle, stuck in a\\nbottle, sputtered beside it.\\n\\nDorian Gray shuddered. He felt that his could not be the hand to take\\nthe handkerchief away, and called out to one of the farm-servants to\\ncome to him.\\n\\n“Take that thing off the face. I wish to see it,” he said, clutching at\\nthe door-post for support.\\n\\nWhen the farm-servant had done so, he stepped forward. A cry of joy\\nbroke from his lips. The man who had been shot in the thicket was James\\nVane.\\n\\nHe stood there for some minutes looking at the dead body. As he rode\\nhome, his eyes were full of tears, for he knew he was safe.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX.\\n\\n\\n“There is no use your telling me that you are going to be good,” cried\\nLord Henry, dipping his white fingers into a red copper bowl filled\\nwith rose-water. “You are quite perfect. Pray, don’t change.”\\n\\nDorian Gray shook his head. “No, Harry, I have done too many dreadful\\nthings in my life. I am not going to do any more. I began my good\\nactions yesterday.”\\n\\n“Where were you yesterday?”\\n\\n“In the country, Harry. I was staying at a little inn by myself.”\\n\\n“My dear boy,” said Lord Henry, smiling, “anybody can be good in the\\ncountry. There are no temptations there. That is the reason why people\\nwho live out of town are so absolutely uncivilized. Civilization is not\\nby any means an easy thing to attain to. There are only two ways by\\nwhich man can reach it. One is by being cultured, the other by being\\ncorrupt. Country people have no opportunity of being either, so they\\nstagnate.”\\n\\n“Culture and corruption,” echoed Dorian. “I have known something of\\nboth. It seems terrible to me now that they should ever be found\\ntogether. For I have a new ideal, Harry. I am going to alter. I think I\\nhave altered.”\\n\\n“You have not yet told me what your good action was. Or did you say you\\nhad done more than one?” asked his companion as he spilled into his\\nplate a little crimson pyramid of seeded strawberries and, through a\\nperforated, shell-shaped spoon, snowed white sugar upon them.\\n\\n“I can tell you, Harry. It is not a story I could tell to any one else.\\nI spared somebody. It sounds vain, but you understand what I mean. She\\nwas quite beautiful and wonderfully like Sibyl Vane. I think it was\\nthat which first attracted me to her. You remember Sibyl, don’t you?\\nHow long ago that seems! Well, Hetty was not one of our own class, of\\ncourse. She was simply a girl in a village. But I really loved her. I\\nam quite sure that I loved her. All during this wonderful May that we\\nhave been having, I used to run down and see her two or three times a\\nweek. Yesterday she met me in a little orchard. The apple-blossoms kept\\ntumbling down on her hair, and she was laughing. We were to have gone\\naway together this morning at dawn. Suddenly I determined to leave her\\nas flowerlike as I had found her.”\\n\\n“I should think the novelty of the emotion must have given you a thrill\\nof real pleasure, Dorian,” interrupted Lord Henry. “But I can finish\\nyour idyll for you. You gave her good advice and broke her heart. That\\nwas the beginning of your reformation.”\\n\\n“Harry, you are horrible! You mustn’t say these dreadful things.\\nHetty’s heart is not broken. Of course, she cried and all that. But\\nthere is no disgrace upon her. She can live, like Perdita, in her\\ngarden of mint and marigold.”\\n\\n“And weep over a faithless Florizel,” said Lord Henry, laughing, as he\\nleaned back in his chair. “My dear Dorian, you have the most curiously\\nboyish moods. Do you think this girl will ever be really content now\\nwith any one of her own rank? I suppose she will be married some day to\\na rough carter or a grinning ploughman. Well, the fact of having met\\nyou, and loved you, will teach her to despise her husband, and she will\\nbe wretched. From a moral point of view, I cannot say that I think much\\nof your great renunciation. Even as a beginning, it is poor. Besides,\\nhow do you know that Hetty isn’t floating at the present moment in some\\nstarlit mill-pond, with lovely water-lilies round her, like Ophelia?”\\n\\n“I can’t bear this, Harry! You mock at everything, and then suggest the\\nmost serious tragedies. I am sorry I told you now. I don’t care what\\nyou say to me. I know I was right in acting as I did. Poor Hetty! As I\\nrode past the farm this morning, I saw her white face at the window,\\nlike a spray of jasmine. Don’t let us talk about it any more, and don’t\\ntry to persuade me that the first good action I have done for years,\\nthe first little bit of self-sacrifice I have ever known, is really a\\nsort of sin. I want to be better. I am going to be better. Tell me\\nsomething about yourself. What is going on in town? I have not been to\\nthe club for days.”\\n\\n“The people are still discussing poor Basil’s disappearance.”\\n\\n“I should have thought they had got tired of that by this time,” said\\nDorian, pouring himself out some wine and frowning slightly.\\n\\n“My dear boy, they have only been talking about it for six weeks, and\\nthe British public are really not equal to the mental strain of having\\nmore than one topic every three months. They have been very fortunate\\nlately, however. They have had my own divorce-case and Alan Campbell’s\\nsuicide. Now they have got the mysterious disappearance of an artist.\\nScotland Yard still insists that the man in the grey ulster who left\\nfor Paris by the midnight train on the ninth of November was poor\\nBasil, and the French police declare that Basil never arrived in Paris\\nat all. I suppose in about a fortnight we shall be told that he has\\nbeen seen in San Francisco. It is an odd thing, but every one who\\ndisappears is said to be seen at San Francisco. It must be a delightful\\ncity, and possess all the attractions of the next world.”\\n\\n“What do you think has happened to Basil?” asked Dorian, holding up his\\nBurgundy against the light and wondering how it was that he could\\ndiscuss the matter so calmly.\\n\\n“I have not the slightest idea. If Basil chooses to hide himself, it is\\nno business of mine. If he is dead, I don’t want to think about him.\\nDeath is the only thing that ever terrifies me. I hate it.”\\n\\n“Why?” said the younger man wearily.\\n\\n“Because,” said Lord Henry, passing beneath his nostrils the gilt\\ntrellis of an open vinaigrette box, “one can survive everything\\nnowadays except that. Death and vulgarity are the only two facts in the\\nnineteenth century that one cannot explain away. Let us have our coffee\\nin the music-room, Dorian. You must play Chopin to me. The man with\\nwhom my wife ran away played Chopin exquisitely. Poor Victoria! I was\\nvery fond of her. The house is rather lonely without her. Of course,\\nmarried life is merely a habit, a bad habit. But then one regrets the\\nloss even of one’s worst habits. Perhaps one regrets them the most.\\nThey are such an essential part of one’s personality.”\\n\\nDorian said nothing, but rose from the table, and passing into the next\\nroom, sat down to the piano and let his fingers stray across the white\\nand black ivory of the keys. After the coffee had been brought in, he\\nstopped, and looking over at Lord Henry, said, “Harry, did it ever\\noccur to you that Basil was murdered?”\\n\\nLord Henry yawned. “Basil was very popular, and always wore a Waterbury\\nwatch. Why should he have been murdered? He was not clever enough to\\nhave enemies. Of course, he had a wonderful genius for painting. But a\\nman can paint like Velasquez and yet be as dull as possible. Basil was\\nreally rather dull. He only interested me once, and that was when he\\ntold me, years ago, that he had a wild adoration for you and that you\\nwere the dominant motive of his art.”\\n\\n“I was very fond of Basil,” said Dorian with a note of sadness in his\\nvoice. “But don’t people say that he was murdered?”\\n\\n“Oh, some of the papers do. It does not seem to me to be at all\\nprobable. I know there are dreadful places in Paris, but Basil was not\\nthe sort of man to have gone to them. He had no curiosity. It was his\\nchief defect.”\\n\\n“What would you say, Harry, if I told you that I had murdered Basil?”\\nsaid the younger man. He watched him intently after he had spoken.\\n\\n“I would say, my dear fellow, that you were posing for a character that\\ndoesn’t suit you. All crime is vulgar, just as all vulgarity is crime.\\nIt is not in you, Dorian, to commit a murder. I am sorry if I hurt your\\nvanity by saying so, but I assure you it is true. Crime belongs\\nexclusively to the lower orders. I don’t blame them in the smallest\\ndegree. I should fancy that crime was to them what art is to us, simply\\na method of procuring extraordinary sensations.”\\n\\n“A method of procuring sensations? Do you think, then, that a man who\\nhas once committed a murder could possibly do the same crime again?\\nDon’t tell me that.”\\n\\n“Oh! anything becomes a pleasure if one does it too often,” cried Lord\\nHenry, laughing. “That is one of the most important secrets of life. I\\nshould fancy, however, that murder is always a mistake. One should\\nnever do anything that one cannot talk about after dinner. But let us\\npass from poor Basil. I wish I could believe that he had come to such a\\nreally romantic end as you suggest, but I can’t. I dare say he fell\\ninto the Seine off an omnibus and that the conductor hushed up the\\nscandal. Yes: I should fancy that was his end. I see him lying now on\\nhis back under those dull-green waters, with the heavy barges floating\\nover him and long weeds catching in his hair. Do you know, I don’t\\nthink he would have done much more good work. During the last ten years\\nhis painting had gone off very much.”\\n\\nDorian heaved a sigh, and Lord Henry strolled across the room and began\\nto stroke the head of a curious Java parrot, a large, grey-plumaged\\nbird with pink crest and tail, that was balancing itself upon a bamboo\\nperch. As his pointed fingers touched it, it dropped the white scurf of\\ncrinkled lids over black, glasslike eyes and began to sway backwards\\nand forwards.\\n\\n“Yes,” he continued, turning round and taking his handkerchief out of\\nhis pocket; “his painting had quite gone off. It seemed to me to have\\nlost something. It had lost an ideal. When you and he ceased to be\\ngreat friends, he ceased to be a great artist. What was it separated\\nyou? I suppose he bored you. If so, he never forgave you. It’s a habit\\nbores have. By the way, what has become of that wonderful portrait he\\ndid of you? I don’t think I have ever seen it since he finished it. Oh!\\nI remember your telling me years ago that you had sent it down to\\nSelby, and that it had got mislaid or stolen on the way. You never got\\nit back? What a pity! it was really a masterpiece. I remember I wanted\\nto buy it. I wish I had now. It belonged to Basil’s best period. Since\\nthen, his work was that curious mixture of bad painting and good\\nintentions that always entitles a man to be called a representative\\nBritish artist. Did you advertise for it? You should.”\\n\\n“I forget,” said Dorian. “I suppose I did. But I never really liked it.\\nI am sorry I sat for it. The memory of the thing is hateful to me. Why\\ndo you talk of it? It used to remind me of those curious lines in some\\nplay—Hamlet, I think—how do they run?—\\n\\n“Like the painting of a sorrow,\\nA face without a heart.”\\n\\n\\nYes: that is what it was like.”\\n\\nLord Henry laughed. “If a man treats life artistically, his brain is\\nhis heart,” he answered, sinking into an arm-chair.\\n\\nDorian Gray shook his head and struck some soft chords on the piano.\\n“‘Like the painting of a sorrow,’” he repeated, “‘a face without a\\nheart.’”\\n\\nThe elder man lay back and looked at him with half-closed eyes. “By the\\nway, Dorian,” he said after a pause, “‘what does it profit a man if he\\ngain the whole world and lose—how does the quotation run?—his own\\nsoul’?”\\n\\nThe music jarred, and Dorian Gray started and stared at his friend.\\n“Why do you ask me that, Harry?”\\n\\n“My dear fellow,” said Lord Henry, elevating his eyebrows in surprise,\\n“I asked you because I thought you might be able to give me an answer.\\nThat is all. I was going through the park last Sunday, and close by the\\nMarble Arch there stood a little crowd of shabby-looking people\\nlistening to some vulgar street-preacher. As I passed by, I heard the\\nman yelling out that question to his audience. It struck me as being\\nrather dramatic. London is very rich in curious effects of that kind. A\\nwet Sunday, an uncouth Christian in a mackintosh, a ring of sickly\\nwhite faces under a broken roof of dripping umbrellas, and a wonderful\\nphrase flung into the air by shrill hysterical lips—it was really very\\ngood in its way, quite a suggestion. I thought of telling the prophet\\nthat art had a soul, but that man had not. I am afraid, however, he\\nwould not have understood me.”\\n\\n“Don’t, Harry. The soul is a terrible reality. It can be bought, and\\nsold, and bartered away. It can be poisoned, or made perfect. There is\\na soul in each one of us. I know it.”\\n\\n“Do you feel quite sure of that, Dorian?”\\n\\n“Quite sure.”\\n\\n“Ah! then it must be an illusion. The things one feels absolutely\\ncertain about are never true. That is the fatality of faith, and the\\nlesson of romance. How grave you are! Don’t be so serious. What have\\nyou or I to do with the superstitions of our age? No: we have given up\\nour belief in the soul. Play me something. Play me a nocturne, Dorian,\\nand, as you play, tell me, in a low voice, how you have kept your\\nyouth. You must have some secret. I am only ten years older than you\\nare, and I am wrinkled, and worn, and yellow. You are really wonderful,\\nDorian. You have never looked more charming than you do to-night. You\\nremind me of the day I saw you first. You were rather cheeky, very shy,\\nand absolutely extraordinary. You have changed, of course, but not in\\nappearance. I wish you would tell me your secret. To get back my youth\\nI would do anything in the world, except take exercise, get up early,\\nor be respectable. Youth! There is nothing like it. It’s absurd to talk\\nof the ignorance of youth. The only people to whose opinions I listen\\nnow with any respect are people much younger than myself. They seem in\\nfront of me. Life has revealed to them her latest wonder. As for the\\naged, I always contradict the aged. I do it on principle. If you ask\\nthem their opinion on something that happened yesterday, they solemnly\\ngive you the opinions current in 1820, when people wore high stocks,\\nbelieved in everything, and knew absolutely nothing. How lovely that\\nthing you are playing is! I wonder, did Chopin write it at Majorca,\\nwith the sea weeping round the villa and the salt spray dashing against\\nthe panes? It is marvellously romantic. What a blessing it is that\\nthere is one art left to us that is not imitative! Don’t stop. I want\\nmusic to-night. It seems to me that you are the young Apollo and that I\\nam Marsyas listening to you. I have sorrows, Dorian, of my own, that\\neven you know nothing of. The tragedy of old age is not that one is\\nold, but that one is young. I am amazed sometimes at my own sincerity.\\nAh, Dorian, how happy you are! What an exquisite life you have had! You\\nhave drunk deeply of everything. You have crushed the grapes against\\nyour palate. Nothing has been hidden from you. And it has all been to\\nyou no more than the sound of music. It has not marred you. You are\\nstill the same.”\\n\\n“I am not the same, Harry.”\\n\\n“Yes, you are the same. I wonder what the rest of your life will be.\\nDon’t spoil it by renunciations. At present you are a perfect type.\\nDon’t make yourself incomplete. You are quite flawless now. You need\\nnot shake your head: you know you are. Besides, Dorian, don’t deceive\\nyourself. Life is not governed by will or intention. Life is a question\\nof nerves, and fibres, and slowly built-up cells in which thought hides\\nitself and passion has its dreams. You may fancy yourself safe and\\nthink yourself strong. But a chance tone of colour in a room or a\\nmorning sky, a particular perfume that you had once loved and that\\nbrings subtle memories with it, a line from a forgotten poem that you\\nhad come across again, a cadence from a piece of music that you had\\nceased to play—I tell you, Dorian, that it is on things like these that\\nour lives depend. Browning writes about that somewhere; but our own\\nsenses will imagine them for us. There are moments when the odour of\\n_lilas blanc_ passes suddenly across me, and I have to live the\\nstrangest month of my life over again. I wish I could change places\\nwith you, Dorian. The world has cried out against us both, but it has\\nalways worshipped you. It always will worship you. You are the type of\\nwhat the age is searching for, and what it is afraid it has found. I am\\nso glad that you have never done anything, never carved a statue, or\\npainted a picture, or produced anything outside of yourself! Life has\\nbeen your art. You have set yourself to music. Your days are your\\nsonnets.”\\n\\nDorian rose up from the piano and passed his hand through his hair.\\n“Yes, life has been exquisite,” he murmured, “but I am not going to\\nhave the same life, Harry. And you must not say these extravagant\\nthings to me. You don’t know everything about me. I think that if you\\ndid, even you would turn from me. You laugh. Don’t laugh.”\\n\\n“Why have you stopped playing, Dorian? Go back and give me the nocturne\\nover again. Look at that great, honey-coloured moon that hangs in the\\ndusky air. She is waiting for you to charm her, and if you play she\\nwill come closer to the earth. You won’t? Let us go to the club, then.\\nIt has been a charming evening, and we must end it charmingly. There is\\nsome one at White’s who wants immensely to know you—young Lord Poole,\\nBournemouth’s eldest son. He has already copied your neckties, and has\\nbegged me to introduce him to you. He is quite delightful and rather\\nreminds me of you.”\\n\\n“I hope not,” said Dorian with a sad look in his eyes. “But I am tired\\nto-night, Harry. I shan’t go to the club. It is nearly eleven, and I\\nwant to go to bed early.”\\n\\n“Do stay. You have never played so well as to-night. There was\\nsomething in your touch that was wonderful. It had more expression than\\nI had ever heard from it before.”\\n\\n“It is because I am going to be good,” he answered, smiling. “I am a\\nlittle changed already.”\\n\\n“You cannot change to me, Dorian,” said Lord Henry. “You and I will\\nalways be friends.”\\n\\n“Yet you poisoned me with a book once. I should not forgive that.\\nHarry, promise me that you will never lend that book to any one. It\\ndoes harm.”\\n\\n“My dear boy, you are really beginning to moralize. You will soon be\\ngoing about like the converted, and the revivalist, warning people\\nagainst all the sins of which you have grown tired. You are much too\\ndelightful to do that. Besides, it is no use. You and I are what we\\nare, and will be what we will be. As for being poisoned by a book,\\nthere is no such thing as that. Art has no influence upon action. It\\nannihilates the desire to act. It is superbly sterile. The books that\\nthe world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame.\\nThat is all. But we won’t discuss literature. Come round to-morrow. I\\nam going to ride at eleven. We might go together, and I will take you\\nto lunch afterwards with Lady Branksome. She is a charming woman, and\\nwants to consult you about some tapestries she is thinking of buying.\\nMind you come. Or shall we lunch with our little duchess? She says she\\nnever sees you now. Perhaps you are tired of Gladys? I thought you\\nwould be. Her clever tongue gets on one’s nerves. Well, in any case, be\\nhere at eleven.”\\n\\n“Must I really come, Harry?”\\n\\n“Certainly. The park is quite lovely now. I don’t think there have been\\nsuch lilacs since the year I met you.”\\n\\n“Very well. I shall be here at eleven,” said Dorian. “Good night,\\nHarry.” As he reached the door, he hesitated for a moment, as if he had\\nsomething more to say. Then he sighed and went out.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XX.\\n\\n\\nIt was a lovely night, so warm that he threw his coat over his arm and\\ndid not even put his silk scarf round his throat. As he strolled home,\\nsmoking his cigarette, two young men in evening dress passed him. He\\nheard one of them whisper to the other, “That is Dorian Gray.” He\\nremembered how pleased he used to be when he was pointed out, or stared\\nat, or talked about. He was tired of hearing his own name now. Half the\\ncharm of the little village where he had been so often lately was that\\nno one knew who he was. He had often told the girl whom he had lured to\\nlove him that he was poor, and she had believed him. He had told her\\nonce that he was wicked, and she had laughed at him and answered that\\nwicked people were always very old and very ugly. What a laugh she\\nhad!—just like a thrush singing. And how pretty she had been in her\\ncotton dresses and her large hats! She knew nothing, but she had\\neverything that he had lost.\\n\\nWhen he reached home, he found his servant waiting up for him. He sent\\nhim to bed, and threw himself down on the sofa in the library, and\\nbegan to think over some of the things that Lord Henry had said to him.\\n\\nWas it really true that one could never change? He felt a wild longing\\nfor the unstained purity of his boyhood—his rose-white boyhood, as Lord\\nHenry had once called it. He knew that he had tarnished himself, filled\\nhis mind with corruption and given horror to his fancy; that he had\\nbeen an evil influence to others, and had experienced a terrible joy in\\nbeing so; and that of the lives that had crossed his own, it had been\\nthe fairest and the most full of promise that he had brought to shame.\\nBut was it all irretrievable? Was there no hope for him?\\n\\nAh! in what a monstrous moment of pride and passion he had prayed that\\nthe portrait should bear the burden of his days, and he keep the\\nunsullied splendour of eternal youth! All his failure had been due to\\nthat. Better for him that each sin of his life had brought its sure\\nswift penalty along with it. There was purification in punishment. Not\\n“Forgive us our sins” but “Smite us for our iniquities” should be the\\nprayer of man to a most just God.\\n\\nThe curiously carved mirror that Lord Henry had given to him, so many\\nyears ago now, was standing on the table, and the white-limbed Cupids\\nlaughed round it as of old. He took it up, as he had done on that night\\nof horror when he had first noted the change in the fatal picture, and\\nwith wild, tear-dimmed eyes looked into its polished shield. Once, some\\none who had terribly loved him had written to him a mad letter, ending\\nwith these idolatrous words: “The world is changed because you are made\\nof ivory and gold. The curves of your lips rewrite history.” The\\nphrases came back to his memory, and he repeated them over and over to\\nhimself. Then he loathed his own beauty, and flinging the mirror on the\\nfloor, crushed it into silver splinters beneath his heel. It was his\\nbeauty that had ruined him, his beauty and the youth that he had prayed\\nfor. But for those two things, his life might have been free from\\nstain. His beauty had been to him but a mask, his youth but a mockery.\\nWhat was youth at best? A green, an unripe time, a time of shallow\\nmoods, and sickly thoughts. Why had he worn its livery? Youth had\\nspoiled him.\\n\\nIt was better not to think of the past. Nothing could alter that. It\\nwas of himself, and of his own future, that he had to think. James Vane\\nwas hidden in a nameless grave in Selby churchyard. Alan Campbell had\\nshot himself one night in his laboratory, but had not revealed the\\nsecret that he had been forced to know. The excitement, such as it was,\\nover Basil Hallward’s disappearance would soon pass away. It was\\nalready waning. He was perfectly safe there. Nor, indeed, was it the\\ndeath of Basil Hallward that weighed most upon his mind. It was the\\nliving death of his own soul that troubled him. Basil had painted the\\nportrait that had marred his life. He could not forgive him that. It\\nwas the portrait that had done everything. Basil had said things to him\\nthat were unbearable, and that he had yet borne with patience. The\\nmurder had been simply the madness of a moment. As for Alan Campbell,\\nhis suicide had been his own act. He had chosen to do it. It was\\nnothing to him.\\n\\nA new life! That was what he wanted. That was what he was waiting for.\\nSurely he had begun it already. He had spared one innocent thing, at\\nany rate. He would never again tempt innocence. He would be good.\\n\\nAs he thought of Hetty Merton, he began to wonder if the portrait in\\nthe locked room had changed. Surely it was not still so horrible as it\\nhad been? Perhaps if his life became pure, he would be able to expel\\nevery sign of evil passion from the face. Perhaps the signs of evil had\\nalready gone away. He would go and look.\\n\\nHe took the lamp from the table and crept upstairs. As he unbarred the\\ndoor, a smile of joy flitted across his strangely young-looking face\\nand lingered for a moment about his lips. Yes, he would be good, and\\nthe hideous thing that he had hidden away would no longer be a terror\\nto him. He felt as if the load had been lifted from him already.\\n\\nHe went in quietly, locking the door behind him, as was his custom, and\\ndragged the purple hanging from the portrait. A cry of pain and\\nindignation broke from him. He could see no change, save that in the\\neyes there was a look of cunning and in the mouth the curved wrinkle of\\nthe hypocrite. The thing was still loathsome—more loathsome, if\\npossible, than before—and the scarlet dew that spotted the hand seemed\\nbrighter, and more like blood newly spilled. Then he trembled. Had it\\nbeen merely vanity that had made him do his one good deed? Or the\\ndesire for a new sensation, as Lord Henry had hinted, with his mocking\\nlaugh? Or that passion to act a part that sometimes makes us do things\\nfiner than we are ourselves? Or, perhaps, all these? And why was the\\nred stain larger than it had been? It seemed to have crept like a\\nhorrible disease over the wrinkled fingers. There was blood on the\\npainted feet, as though the thing had dripped—blood even on the hand\\nthat had not held the knife. Confess? Did it mean that he was to\\nconfess? To give himself up and be put to death? He laughed. He felt\\nthat the idea was monstrous. Besides, even if he did confess, who would\\nbelieve him? There was no trace of the murdered man anywhere.\\nEverything belonging to him had been destroyed. He himself had burned\\nwhat had been below-stairs. The world would simply say that he was mad.\\nThey would shut him up if he persisted in his story.... Yet it was his\\nduty to confess, to suffer public shame, and to make public atonement.\\nThere was a God who called upon men to tell their sins to earth as well\\nas to heaven. Nothing that he could do would cleanse him till he had\\ntold his own sin. His sin? He shrugged his shoulders. The death of\\nBasil Hallward seemed very little to him. He was thinking of Hetty\\nMerton. For it was an unjust mirror, this mirror of his soul that he\\nwas looking at. Vanity? Curiosity? Hypocrisy? Had there been nothing\\nmore in his renunciation than that? There had been something more. At\\nleast he thought so. But who could tell? ... No. There had been nothing\\nmore. Through vanity he had spared her. In hypocrisy he had worn the\\nmask of goodness. For curiosity’s sake he had tried the denial of self.\\nHe recognized that now.\\n\\nBut this murder—was it to dog him all his life? Was he always to be\\nburdened by his past? Was he really to confess? Never. There was only\\none bit of evidence left against him. The picture itself—that was\\nevidence. He would destroy it. Why had he kept it so long? Once it had\\ngiven him pleasure to watch it changing and growing old. Of late he had\\nfelt no such pleasure. It had kept him awake at night. When he had been\\naway, he had been filled with terror lest other eyes should look upon\\nit. It had brought melancholy across his passions. Its mere memory had\\nmarred many moments of joy. It had been like conscience to him. Yes, it\\nhad been conscience. He would destroy it.\\n\\nHe looked round and saw the knife that had stabbed Basil Hallward. He\\nhad cleaned it many times, till there was no stain left upon it. It was\\nbright, and glistened. As it had killed the painter, so it would kill\\nthe painter’s work, and all that that meant. It would kill the past,\\nand when that was dead, he would be free. It would kill this monstrous\\nsoul-life, and without its hideous warnings, he would be at peace. He\\nseized the thing, and stabbed the picture with it.\\n\\nThere was a cry heard, and a crash. The cry was so horrible in its\\nagony that the frightened servants woke and crept out of their rooms.\\nTwo gentlemen, who were passing in the square below, stopped and looked\\nup at the great house. They walked on till they met a policeman and\\nbrought him back. The man rang the bell several times, but there was no\\nanswer. Except for a light in one of the top windows, the house was all\\ndark. After a time, he went away and stood in an adjoining portico and\\nwatched.\\n\\n“Whose house is that, Constable?” asked the elder of the two gentlemen.\\n\\n“Mr. Dorian Gray’s, sir,” answered the policeman.\\n\\nThey looked at each other, as they walked away, and sneered. One of\\nthem was Sir Henry Ashton’s uncle.\\n\\nInside, in the servants’ part of the house, the half-clad domestics\\nwere talking in low whispers to each other. Old Mrs. Leaf was crying\\nand wringing her hands. Francis was as pale as death.\\n\\nAfter about a quarter of an hour, he got the coachman and one of the\\nfootmen and crept upstairs. They knocked, but there was no reply. They\\ncalled out. Everything was still. Finally, after vainly trying to force\\nthe door, they got on the roof and dropped down on to the balcony. The\\nwindows yielded easily—their bolts were old.\\n\\nWhen they entered, they found hanging upon the wall a splendid portrait\\nof their master as they had last seen him, in all the wonder of his\\nexquisite youth and beauty. Lying on the floor was a dead man, in\\nevening dress, with a knife in his heart. He was withered, wrinkled,\\nand loathsome of visage. It was not till they had examined the rings\\nthat they recognized who it was.\\n\\nTHE END\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY ***\\n\\n***** This file should be named 174-0.txt or 174-0.zip *****\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\n    https://www.gutenberg.org/1/7/174/\\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\\nbe renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\\nroyalties.

You may copy it, give it away or\\nre-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included\\nwith this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org\\n\\n\\nTitle: The Virginian\\n       A Horseman Of The Plains\\n\\nAuthor: Owen Wister\\n\\nPosting Date: September 17, 2008 [EBook #1298]\\nRelease Date: May, 1998\\nLast Updated: March 9, 2018\\n\\nLanguage: English\\n\\nCharacter set encoding: UTF-8\\n\\n*** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE VIRGINIAN ***\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProduced by Bill Brewer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE VIRGINIAN\\n\\nA Horseman Of The Plains\\n\\nBy Owen Wister\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTo THEODORE ROOSEVELT\\n\\nSome of these pages you have seen, some you have praised, one stands\\nnew-written because you blamed it; and all, my dear critic, beg leave to\\nremind you of their author's changeless admiration.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTO THE READER\\n\\n\\nCertain of the newspapers, when this book was first announced, made a\\nmistake most natural upon seeing the sub-title as it then stood, A TALE\\nOF SUNDRY ADVENTURES. “This sounds like a historical novel,” said one\\nof them, meaning (I take it) a colonial romance. As it now stands, the\\ntitle will scarce lead to such interpretation; yet none the less is this\\nbook historical--quite as much so as any colonial romance. Indeed,\\nwhen you look at the root of the matter, it is a colonial romance. For\\nWyoming between 1874 and 1890 was a colony as wild as was Virginia one\\nhundred years earlier. As wild, with a scantier population, and the\\nsame primitive joys and dangers. There were, to be sure, not so many\\nChippendale settees.\\n\\nWe know quite well the common understanding of the term “historical\\nnovel.” HUGH WYNNE exactly fits it. But SILAS LAPHAM is a novel as\\nperfectly historical as is Hugh Wynne, for it pictures an era and\\npersonifies a type. It matters not that in the one we find George\\nWashington and in the other none save imaginary figures; else THE\\nSCARLET LETTER were not historical. Nor does it matter that Dr. Mitchell\\ndid not live in the time of which he wrote, while Mr. Howells saw\\nmany Silas Laphams with his own eyes; else UNCLE TOM'S CABIN were\\nnot historical. Any narrative which presents faithfully a day and a\\ngeneration is of necessity historical; and this one presents Wyoming\\nbetween 1874 and 1890. Had you left New York or San Francisco at ten\\no'clock this morning, by noon the day after to-morrow you could step out\\nat Cheyenne. There you would stand at the heart of the world that is\\nthe subject of my picture, yet you would look around you in vain for the\\nreality. It is a vanished world. No journeys, save those which memory\\ncan take, will bring you to it now. The mountains are there, far and\\nshining, and the sunlight, and the infinite earth, and the air that\\nseems forever the true fountain of youth, but where is the buffalo, and\\nthe wild antelope, and where the horseman with his pasturing thousands?\\nSo like its old self does the sage-brush seem when revisited, that you\\nwait for the horseman to appear.\\n\\nBut he will never come again. He rides in his historic yesterday. You\\nwill no more see him gallop out of the unchanging silence than you will\\nsee Columbus on the unchanging sea come sailing from Palos with his\\ncaravels.\\n\\nAnd yet the horseman is still so near our day that in some chapters of\\nthis book, which were published separate at the close of the nineteenth\\ncentury, the present tense was used. It is true no longer. In those\\nchapters it has been changed, and verbs like “is” and “have” now read\\n“was” and “had.” Time has flowed faster than my ink.\\n\\nWhat is become of the horseman, the cow-puncher, the last romantic figure\\nupon our soil? For he was romantic. Whatever he did, he did with his\\nmight. The bread that he earned was earned hard, the wages that he\\nsquandered were squandered hard,--half a year's pay sometimes gone in a\\nnight,--“blown in,” as he expressed it, or “blowed in,” to be perfectly\\naccurate. Well, he will be here among us always, invisible, waiting his\\nchance to live and play as he would like. His wild kind has been among\\nus always, since the beginning: a young man with his temptations, a hero\\nwithout wings.\\n\\nThe cow-puncher's ungoverned hours did not unman him. If he gave his\\nword, he kept it; Wall Street would have found him behind the times.\\nNor did he talk lewdly to women; Newport would have thought him\\nold-fashioned. He and his brief epoch make a complete picture, for in\\nthemselves they were as complete as the pioneers of the land or the\\nexplorers of the sea. A transition has followed the horseman of the\\nplains; a shapeless state, a condition of men and manners as unlovely as\\nis that moment in the year when winter is gone and spring not come, and\\nthe face of Nature is ugly. I shall not dwell upon it here. Those who\\nhave seen it know well what I mean. Such transition was inevitable. Let\\nus give thanks that it is but a transition, and not a finality.\\n\\nSometimes readers inquire, Did I know the Virginian? As well, I hope,\\nas a father should know his son. And sometimes it is asked, Was such and\\nsuch a thing true? Now to this I have the best answer in the world.\\nOnce a cow-puncher listened patiently while I read him a manuscript.\\nIt concerned an event upon an Indian reservation. “Was that the Crow\\nreservation?” he inquired at the finish. I told him that it was no\\nreal reservation and no real event; and his face expressed displeasure.\\n“Why,” he demanded, “do you waste your time writing what never happened,\\nwhen you know so many things that did happen?”\\n\\nAnd I could no more help telling him that this was the highest\\ncompliment ever paid me than I have been able to help telling you about\\nit here!\\n\\nCHARLESTON, S.C., March 31st, 1902\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE VIRGINIAN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI. ENTER THE MAN\\n\\n\\nSome notable sight was drawing the passengers, both men and women, to\\nthe window; and therefore I rose and crossed the car to see what it was.\\nI saw near the track an enclosure, and round it some laughing men, and\\ninside it some whirling dust, and amid the dust some horses, plunging,\\nhuddling, and dodging. They were cow ponies in a corral, and one of them\\nwould not be caught, no matter who threw the rope. We had plenty of time\\nto watch this sport, for our train had stopped that the engine might\\ntake water at the tank before it pulled us up beside the station\\nplatform of Medicine Bow. We were also six hours late, and starving for\\nentertainment. The pony in the corral was wise, and rapid of limb. Have\\nyou seen a skilful boxer watch his antagonist with a quiet, incessant\\neye? Such an eye as this did the pony keep upon whatever man took the\\nrope. The man might pretend to look at the weather, which was fine; or\\nhe might affect earnest conversation with a bystander: it was bootless.\\nThe pony saw through it. No feint hoodwinked him. This animal was\\nthoroughly a man of the world. His undistracted eye stayed fixed upon\\nthe dissembling foe, and the gravity of his horse-expression made the\\nmatter one of high comedy. Then the rope would sail out at him, but he\\nwas already elsewhere; and if horses laugh, gayety must have abounded in\\nthat corral. Sometimes the pony took a turn alone; next he had slid in a\\nflash among his brothers, and the whole of them like a school of playful\\nfish whipped round the corral, kicking up the fine dust, and (I take it)\\nroaring with laughter. Through the window-glass of our Pullman the thud\\nof their mischievous hoofs reached us, and the strong, humorous curses\\nof the cow-boys. Then for the first time I noticed a man who sat on the\\nhigh gate of the corral, looking on. For he now climbed down with\\nthe undulations of a tiger, smooth and easy, as if his muscles flowed\\nbeneath his skin. The others had all visibly whirled the rope, some of\\nthem even shoulder high. I did not see his arm lift or move. He appeared\\nto hold the rope down low, by his leg. But like a sudden snake I saw the\\nnoose go out its length and fall true; and the thing was done. As the\\ncaptured pony walked in with a sweet, church-door expression, our train\\nmoved slowly on to the station, and a passenger remarked, “That man\\nknows his business.”\\n\\nBut the passenger's dissertation upon roping I was obliged to lose, for\\nMedicine Bow was my station. I bade my fellow-travellers good-by, and\\ndescended, a stranger, into the great cattle land. And here in less than\\nten minutes I learned news which made me feel a stranger indeed.\\n\\nMy baggage was lost; it had not come on my train; it was adrift\\nsomewhere back in the two thousand miles that lay behind me. And by way\\nof comfort, the baggage-man remarked that passengers often got astray\\nfrom their trunks, but the trunks mostly found them after a while.\\nHaving offered me this encouragement, he turned whistling to his\\naffairs and left me planted in the baggage-room at Medicine Bow. I stood\\ndeserted among crates and boxes, blankly holding my check, hungry and\\nforlorn. I stared out through the door at the sky and the plains; but\\nI did not see the antelope shining among the sage-brush, nor the great\\nsunset light of Wyoming. Annoyance blinded my eyes to all things save\\nmy grievance: I saw only a lost trunk. And I was muttering half-aloud,\\n“What a forsaken hole this is!” when suddenly from outside on the\\nplatform came a slow voice: “Off to get married AGAIN? Oh, don't!”\\n\\nThe voice was Southern and gentle and drawling; and a second voice came\\nin immediate answer, cracked and querulous. “It ain't again. Who says\\nit's again? Who told you, anyway?”\\n\\nAnd the first voice responded caressingly: “Why, your Sunday clothes\\ntold me, Uncle Hughey. They are speakin' mighty loud o' nuptials.”\\n\\n“You don't worry me!” snapped Uncle Hughey, with shrill heat.\\n\\nAnd the other gently continued, “Ain't them gloves the same yu' wore to\\nyour last weddin'?”\\n\\n“You don't worry me! You don't worry me!” now screamed Uncle Hughey.\\n\\nAlready I had forgotten my trunk; care had left me; I was aware of the\\nsunset, and had no desire but for more of this conversation. For it\\nresembled none that I had heard in my life so far. I stepped to the door\\nand looked out upon the station platform.\\n\\nLounging there at ease against the wall was a slim young giant,\\nmore beautiful than pictures. His broad, soft hat was pushed back; a\\nloose-knotted, dull-scarlet handkerchief sagged from his throat; and one\\ncasual thumb was hooked in the cartridge-belt that slanted across his\\nhips. He had plainly come many miles from somewhere across the vast\\nhorizon, as the dust upon him showed. His boots were white with it. His\\noveralls were gray with it. The weather-beaten bloom of his face shone\\nthrough it duskily, as the ripe peaches look upon their trees in a dry\\nseason. But no dinginess of travel or shabbiness of attire could tarnish\\nthe splendor that radiated from his youth and strength. The old man\\nupon whose temper his remarks were doing such deadly work was combed and\\ncurried to a finish, a bridegroom swept and garnished; but alas for age!\\nHad I been the bride, I should have taken the giant, dust and all. He\\nhad by no means done with the old man.\\n\\n“Why, yu've hung weddin' gyarments on every limb!” he now drawled, with\\nadmiration. “Who is the lucky lady this trip?”\\n\\nThe old man seemed to vibrate. “Tell you there ain't been no other! Call\\nme a Mormon, would you?”\\n\\n“Why, that--”\\n\\n“Call me a Mormon? Then name some of my wives. Name two. Name one. Dare\\nyou!”\\n\\n“--that Laramie wido' promised you--'\\n\\n“Shucks!”\\n\\n“--only her doctor suddenly ordered Southern climate and--”\\n\\n“Shucks! You're a false alarm.”\\n\\n“--so nothing but her lungs came between you. And next you'd most got\\nunited with Cattle Kate, only--”\\n\\n“Tell you you're a false alarm!”\\n\\n“--only she got hung.”\\n\\n“Where's the wives in all this? Show the wives! Come now!”\\n\\n“That corn-fed biscuit-shooter at Rawlins yu' gave the canary--”\\n\\n“Never married her. Never did marry--”\\n\\n“But yu' come so near, uncle! She was the one left yu' that letter\\nexplaining how she'd got married to a young cyard-player the very day\\nbefore her ceremony with you was due, and--”\\n\\n“Oh, you're nothing; you're a kid; you don't amount to--”\\n\\n“--and how she'd never, never forgot to feed the canary.”\\n\\n“This country's getting full of kids,” stated the old man, witheringly.\\n“It's doomed.” This crushing assertion plainly satisfied him. And he\\nblinked his eyes with renewed anticipation. His tall tormentor continued\\nwith a face of unchanging gravity, and a voice of gentle solicitude:\\n“How is the health of that unfortunate--”\\n\\n“That's right! Pour your insults! Pour 'em on a sick, afflicted woman!”\\n The eyes blinked with combative relish.\\n\\n“Insults? Oh, no, Uncle Hughey!”\\n\\n“That's all right! Insults goes!”\\n\\n“Why, I was mighty relieved when she began to recover her mem'ry. Las'\\ntime I heard, they told me she'd got it pretty near all back. Remembered\\nher father, and her mother, and her sisters and brothers, and her\\nfriends, and her happy childhood, and all her doin's except only your\\nface. The boys was bettin' she'd get that far too, give her time. But\\nI reckon afteh such a turrable sickness as she had, that would be\\nexpectin' most too much.”\\n\\nAt this Uncle Hughey jerked out a small parcel. “Shows how much you\\nknow!” he cackled. “There! See that! That's my ring she sent me back,\\nbeing too unstrung for marriage. So she don't remember me, don't she?\\nHa-ha! Always said you were a false alarm.”\\n\\nThe Southerner put more anxiety into his tone. “And so you're a-takin'\\nthe ring right on to the next one!” he exclaimed. “Oh, don't go to get\\nmarried again, Uncle Hughey! What's the use o' being married?”\\n\\n“What's the use?” echoed the bridegroom, with scorn. “Hm! When you grow\\nup you'll think different.”\\n\\n“Course I expect to think different when my age is different. I'm havin'\\nthe thoughts proper to twenty-four, and you're havin' the thoughts\\nproper to sixty.”\\n\\n“Fifty!” shrieked Uncle Hughey, jumping in the air.\\n\\nThe Southerner took a tone of self-reproach. “Now, how could I forget\\nyou was fifty,” he murmured, “when you have been telling it to the boys\\nso careful for the last ten years!”\\n\\nHave you ever seen a cockatoo--the white kind with the top-knot--enraged\\nby insult? The bird erects every available feather upon its person.\\nSo did Uncle Hughey seem to swell, clothes, mustache, and woolly white\\nbeard; and without further speech he took himself on board the Eastbound\\ntrain, which now arrived from its siding in time to deliver him.\\n\\nYet this was not why he had not gone away before. At any time he could\\nhave escaped into the baggage-room or withdrawn to a dignified distance\\nuntil his train should come up. But the old man had evidently got a sort\\nof joy from this teasing. He had reached that inevitable age when we are\\ntickled to be linked with affairs of gallantry, no matter how.\\n\\nWith him now the Eastbound departed slowly into that distance whence\\nI had come. I stared after it as it went its way to the far shores of\\ncivilization. It grew small in the unending gulf of space, until all\\nsign of its presence was gone save a faint skein of smoke against the\\nevening sky. And now my lost trunk came back into my thoughts, and\\nMedicine Bow seemed a lonely spot. A sort of ship had left me marooned\\nin a foreign ocean; the Pullman was comfortably steaming home to port,\\nwhile I--how was I to find Judge Henry's ranch? Where in this unfeatured\\nwilderness was Sunk Creek? No creek or any water at all flowed here that\\nI could perceive. My host had written he should meet me at the station\\nand drive me to his ranch. This was all that I knew. He was not here.\\nThe baggage-man had not seen him lately. The ranch was almost certain\\nto be too far to walk to, to-night. My trunk--I discovered myself still\\nstaring dolefully after the vanished East-bound; and at the same instant\\nI became aware that the tall man was looking gravely at me,--as\\ngravely as he had looked at Uncle Hughey throughout their remarkable\\nconversation.\\n\\nTo see his eye thus fixing me and his thumb still hooked in his\\ncartridge-belt, certain tales of travellers from these parts forced\\nthemselves disquietingly into my recollection. Now that Uncle Hughey was\\ngone, was I to take his place and be, for instance, invited to dance on\\nthe platform to the music of shots nicely aimed?\\n\\n“I reckon I am looking for you, seh,” the tall man now observed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII. “WHEN YOU CALL ME THAT, SMILE!”\\n\\n\\nWe cannot see ourselves as others see us, or I should know what\\nappearance I cut at hearing this from the tall man. I said nothing,\\nfeeling uncertain.\\n\\n“I reckon I am looking for you, seh,” he repeated politely.\\n\\n“I am looking for Judge Henry,” I now replied.\\n\\nHe walked toward me, and I saw that in inches he was not a giant. He was\\nnot more than six feet. It was Uncle Hughey that had made him seem to\\ntower. But in his eye, in his face, in his step, in the whole man,\\nthere dominated a something potent to be felt, I should think, by man or\\nwoman.\\n\\n“The Judge sent me afteh you, seh,” he now explained, in his civil\\nSouthern voice; and he handed me a letter from my host. Had I not\\nwitnessed his facetious performances with Uncle Hughey, I should have\\njudged him wholly ungifted with such powers. There was nothing external\\nabout him but what seemed the signs of a nature as grave as you could\\nmeet. But I had witnessed; and therefore supposing that I knew him in\\nspite of his appearance, that I was, so to speak, in his secret and\\ncould give him a sort of wink, I adopted at once a method of easiness.\\nIt was so pleasant to be easy with a large stranger, who instead of\\nshooting at your heels had very civilly handed you a letter.\\n\\n“You're from old Virginia, I take it?” I began.\\n\\nHe answered slowly, “Then you have taken it correct, seh.”\\n\\nA slight chill passed over my easiness, but I went cheerily on with a\\nfurther inquiry. “Find many oddities out here like Uncle Hughey?”\\n\\n“Yes, seh, there is a right smart of oddities around. They come in on\\nevery train.”\\n\\nAt this point I dropped my method of easiness.\\n\\n“I wish that trunks came on the train,” said I. And I told him my\\npredicament.\\n\\nIt was not to be expected that he would be greatly moved at my loss; but\\nhe took it with no comment whatever. “We'll wait in town for it,” said\\nhe, always perfectly civil.\\n\\nNow, what I had seen of “town” was, to my newly arrived eyes, altogether\\nhorrible. If I could possibly sleep at the Judge's ranch, I preferred to\\ndo so.\\n\\n“Is it too far to drive there to-night?” I inquired.\\n\\nHe looked at me in a puzzled manner.\\n\\n“For this valise,” I explained, “contains all that I immediately need;\\nin fact, I could do without my trunk for a day or two, if it is not\\nconvenient to send. So if we could arrive there not too late by starting\\nat once--” I paused.\\n\\n“It's two hundred and sixty-three miles,” said the Virginian.\\n\\nTo my loud ejaculation he made no answer, but surveyed me a moment\\nlonger, and then said, “Supper will be about ready now.” He took my\\nvalise, and I followed his steps toward the eating-house in silence. I\\nwas dazed.\\n\\nAs we went, I read my host's letter--a brief hospitable message. He was\\nvery sorry not to meet me himself. He had been getting ready to drive\\nover, when the surveyor appeared and detained him. Therefore in his\\nstead he was sending a trustworthy man to town, who would look after\\nme and drive me over. They were looking forward to my visit with much\\npleasure. This was all.\\n\\nYes, I was dazed. How did they count distance in this country? You spoke\\nin a neighborly fashion about driving over to town, and it meant--I\\ndid not know yet how many days. And what would be meant by the term\\n“dropping in,” I wondered. And how many miles would be considered really\\nfar? I abstained from further questioning the “trustworthy man.” My\\nquestions had not fared excessively well. He did not propose making me\\ndance, to be sure: that would scarcely be trustworthy. But neither did\\nhe propose to have me familiar with him. Why was this? What had I done\\nto elicit that veiled and skilful sarcasm about oddities coming in on\\nevery train? Having been sent to look after me, he would do so,\\nwould even carry my valise; but I could not be jocular with him. This\\nhandsome, ungrammatical son of the soil had set between us the bar of\\nhis cold and perfect civility. No polished person could have done it\\nbetter. What was the matter? I looked at him, and suddenly it came to\\nme. If he had tried familiarity with me the first two minutes of our\\nacquaintance, I should have resented it; by what right, then, had I\\ntried it with him? It smacked of patronizing: on this occasion he had\\ncome off the better gentleman of the two. Here in flesh and blood was\\na truth which I had long believed in words, but never met before. The\\ncreature we call a GENTLEMAN lies deep in the hearts of thousands that\\nare born without chance to master the outward graces of the type.\\n\\nBetween the station and the eating-house I did a deal of straight\\nthinking. But my thoughts were destined presently to be drowned in\\namazement at the rare personage into whose society fate had thrown me.\\n\\nTown, as they called it, pleased me the less, the longer I saw it. But\\nuntil our language stretches itself and takes in a new word of closer\\nfit, town will have to do for the name of such a place as was Medicine\\nBow. I have seen and slept in many like it since. Scattered wide, they\\nlittered the frontier from the Columbia to the Rio Grande, from the\\nMissouri to the Sierras. They lay stark, dotted over a planet of\\ntreeless dust, like soiled packs of cards. Each was similar to the next,\\nas one old five-spot of clubs resembles another. Houses, empty bottles,\\nand garbage, they were forever of the same shapeless pattern. More\\nforlorn they were than stale bones. They seemed to have been strewn\\nthere by the wind and to be waiting till the wind should come again and\\nblow them away. Yet serene above their foulness swam a pure and quiet\\nlight, such as the East never sees; they might be bathing in the air of\\ncreation's first morning. Beneath sun and stars their days and nights\\nwere immaculate and wonderful.\\n\\nMedicine Bow was my first, and I took its dimensions, twenty-nine\\nbuildings in all,--one coal shute, one water tank, the station, one\\nstore, two eating-houses, one billiard hall, two tool-houses, one feed\\nstable, and twelve others that for one reason and another I shall not\\nname. Yet this wretched husk of squalor spent thought upon appearances;\\nmany houses in it wore a false front to seem as if they were two stories\\nhigh. There they stood, rearing their pitiful masquerade amid a fringe\\nof old tin cans, while at their very doors began a world of crystal\\nlight, a land without end, a space across which Noah and Adam might come\\nstraight from Genesis. Into that space went wandering a road, over a\\nhill and down out of sight, and up again smaller in the distance, and\\ndown once more, and up once more, straining the eyes, and so away.\\n\\nThen I heard a fellow greet my Virginian. He came rollicking out of\\na door, and made a pass with his hand at the Virginian's hat. The\\nSoutherner dodged it, and I saw once more the tiger undulation of body,\\nand knew my escort was he of the rope and the corral.\\n\\n“How are yu' Steve?” he said to the rollicking man. And in his tone I\\nheard instantly old friendship speaking. With Steve he would take and\\ngive familiarity.\\n\\nSteve looked at me, and looked away--and that was all. But it was\\nenough. In no company had I ever felt so much an outsider. Yet I liked\\nthe company, and wished that it would like me.\\n\\n“Just come to town?” inquired Steve of the Virginian.\\n\\n“Been here since noon. Been waiting for the train.”\\n\\n“Going out to-night?”\\n\\n“I reckon I'll pull out to-morro'.”\\n\\n“Beds are all took,” said Steve. This was for my benefit.\\n\\n“Dear me,” said I.\\n\\n“But I guess one of them drummers will let yu' double up with him.”\\n Steve was enjoying himself, I think. He had his saddle and blankets, and\\nbeds were nothing to him.\\n\\n“Drummers, are they?” asked the Virginian.\\n\\n“Two Jews handling cigars, one American with consumption killer, and a\\nDutchman with jew'lry.”\\n\\nThe Virginian set down my valise, and seemed to meditate. “I did want a\\nbed to-night,” he murmured gently.\\n\\n“Well,” Steve suggested, “the American looks like he washed the\\noftenest.”\\n\\n“That's of no consequence to me,” observed the Southerner.\\n\\n“Guess it'll be when yu' see 'em.”\\n\\n“Oh, I'm meaning something different. I wanted a bed to myself.”\\n\\n“Then you'll have to build one.”\\n\\n“Bet yu' I have the Dutchman's.”\\n\\n“Take a man that won't scare. Bet yu' drinks yu' can't have the\\nAmerican's.”\\n\\n“Go yu'” said the Virginian. “I'll have his bed without any fuss. Drinks\\nfor the crowd.”\\n\\n“I suppose you have me beat,” said Steve, grinning at him\\naffectionately. “You're such a son-of-a---- when you get down to work.\\nWell, so long! I got to fix my horse's hoofs.”\\n\\nI had expected that the man would be struck down. He had used to the\\nVirginian a term of heaviest insult, I thought. I had marvelled to hear\\nit come so unheralded from Steve's friendly lips. And now I marvelled\\nstill more. Evidently he had meant no harm by it, and evidently\\nno offence had been taken. Used thus, this language was plainly\\ncomplimentary. I had stepped into a world new to me indeed, and\\nnovelties were occurring with scarce any time to get breath between\\nthem. As to where I should sleep, I had forgotten that problem\\naltogether in my curiosity. What was the Virginian going to do now? I\\nbegan to know that the quiet of this man was volcanic.\\n\\n“Will you wash first, sir?”\\n\\nWe were at the door of the eating-house, and he set my valise inside.\\nIn my tenderfoot innocence I was looking indoors for the washing\\narrangements.\\n\\n“It's out hyeh, seh,” he informed me gravely, but with strong Southern\\naccent. Internal mirth seemed often to heighten the local flavor of his\\nspeech. There were other times when it had scarce any special accent or\\nfault in grammar.\\n\\nA trough was to my right, slippery with soapy water; and hanging from\\na roller above one end of it was a rag of discouraging appearance. The\\nVirginian caught it, and it performed one whirling revolution on its\\nroller. Not a dry or clean inch could be found on it. He took off his\\nhat, and put his head in the door.\\n\\n“Your towel, ma'am,” said he, “has been too popular.”\\n\\nShe came out, a pretty woman. Her eyes rested upon him for a moment,\\nthen upon me with disfavor; then they returned to his black hair.\\n\\n“The allowance is one a day,” said she, very quietly. “But when folks\\nare particular--” She completed her sentence by removing the old towel\\nand giving a clean one to us.\\n\\n“Thank you, ma'am,” said the cow-puncher.\\n\\nShe looked once more at his black hair, and without any word returned to\\nher guests at supper.\\n\\nA pail stood in the trough, almost empty; and this he filled for me from\\na well. There was some soap sliding at large in the trough, but I got my\\nown. And then in a tin basin I removed as many of the stains of travel\\nas I was able. It was not much of a toilet that I made in this first\\nwash-trough of my experience, but it had to suffice, and I took my seat\\nat supper.\\n\\nCanned stuff it was,--corned beef. And one of my table companions said\\nthe truth about it. “When I slung my teeth over that,” he remarked, “I\\nthought I was chewing a hammock.” We had strange coffee, and condensed\\nmilk; and I have never seen more flies. I made no attempt to talk,\\nfor no one in this country seemed favorable to me. By reason of\\nsomething,--my clothes, my hat, my pronunciation, whatever it might be,\\nI possessed the secret of estranging people at sight. Yet I was doing\\nbetter than I knew; my strict silence and attention to the corned beef\\nmade me in the eyes of the cow-boys at table compare well with the\\nover-talkative commercial travellers.\\n\\nThe Virginian's entrance produced a slight silence. He had done wonders\\nwith the wash-trough, and he had somehow brushed his clothes. With all\\nthe roughness of his dress, he was now the neatest of us. He nodded to\\nsome of the other cow-boys, and began his meal in quiet.\\n\\nBut silence is not the native element of the drummer. An average fish\\ncan go a longer time out of water than this breed can live without\\ntalking. One of them now looked across the table at the grave,\\nflannel-shirted Virginian; he inspected, and came to the imprudent\\nconclusion that he understood his man.\\n\\n“Good evening,” he said briskly.\\n\\n“Good evening,” said the Virginian.\\n\\n“Just come to town?” pursued the drummer.\\n\\n“Just come to town,” the Virginian suavely assented.\\n\\n“Cattle business jumping along?” inquired the drummer.\\n\\n“Oh, fair.” And the Virginian took some more corned beef.\\n\\n“Gets a move on your appetite, anyway,” suggested the drummer.\\n\\nThe Virginian drank some coffee. Presently the pretty woman refilled his\\ncup without his asking her.\\n\\n“Guess I've met you before,” the drummer stated next.\\n\\nThe Virginian glanced at him for a brief moment.\\n\\n“Haven't I, now? Ain't I seen you somewhere? Look at me. You been in\\nChicago, ain't you? You look at me well. Remember Ikey's, don't you?”\\n\\n“I don't reckon I do.”\\n\\n“See, now! I knowed you'd been in Chicago. Four or five years ago. Or\\nmaybe it's two years. Time's nothing to me. But I never forget a face.\\nYes, sir. Him and me's met at Ikey's, all right.” This important point\\nthe drummer stated to all of us. We were called to witness how well he\\nhad proved old acquaintanceship. “Ain't the world small, though!” he\\nexclaimed complacently. “Meet a man once and you're sure to run on to\\nhim again. That's straight. That's no bar-room josh.” And the drummer's\\neye included us all in his confidence. I wondered if he had attained\\nthat high perfection when a man believes his own lies.\\n\\nThe Virginian did not seem interested. He placidly attended to his\\nfood, while our landlady moved between dining room and kitchen, and the\\ndrummer expanded.\\n\\n“Yes, sir! Ikey's over by the stock-yards, patronized by all cattle-men\\nthat know what's what. That's where. Maybe it's three years. Time never\\nwas nothing to me. But faces! Why, I can't quit 'em. Adults or children,\\nmale and female; onced I seen 'em I couldn't lose one off my memory, not\\nif you were to pay me bounty, five dollars a face. White men, that is.\\nCan't do nothing with niggers or Chinese. But you're white, all\\nright.” The drummer suddenly returned to the Virginian with this high\\ncompliment. The cow-puncher had taken out a pipe, and was slowly rubbing\\nit. The compliment seemed to escape his attention, and the drummer went\\non.\\n\\n“I can tell a man when he's white, put him at Ikey's or out loose here\\nin the sage-brush.” And he rolled a cigar across to the Virginian's\\nplate.\\n\\n“Selling them?” inquired the Virginian.\\n\\n“Solid goods, my friend. Havana wrappers, the biggest tobacco\\nproposition for five cents got out yet. Take it, try it, light it, watch\\nit burn. Here.” And he held out a bunch of matches.\\n\\nThe Virginian tossed a five-cent piece over to him.\\n\\n“Oh, no, my friend! Not from you! Not after Ikey's. I don't forget you.\\nSee? I knowed your face right away. See? That's straight. I seen you at\\nChicago all right.”\\n\\n“Maybe you did,” said the Virginian. “Sometimes I'm mighty careless what\\nI look at.”\\n\\n“Well, py damn!” now exclaimed the Dutch drummer, hilariously. “I am\\nploom disappointed. I vas hoping to sell him somedings myself.”\\n\\n“Not the same here,” stated the American. “He's too healthy for me. I\\ngave him up on sight.”\\n\\nNow it was the American drummer whose bed the Virginian had in his eye.\\nThis was a sensible man, and had talked less than his brothers in the\\ntrade. I had little doubt who would end by sleeping in his bed; but how\\nthe thing would be done interested me more deeply than ever.\\n\\nThe Virginian looked amiably at his intended victim, and made one or two\\nremarks regarding patent medicines. There must be a good deal of money\\nin them, he supposed, with a live man to manage them. The victim was\\nflattered. No other person at the table had been favored with so much\\nof the tall cow-puncher's notice. He responded, and they had a pleasant\\ntalk. I did not divine that the Virginian's genius was even then at\\nwork, and that all this was part of his satanic strategy. But Steve must\\nhave divined it. For while a few of us still sat finishing our supper,\\nthat facetious horseman returned from doctoring his horse's hoofs, put\\nhis head into the dining room, took in the way in which the Virginian\\nwas engaging his victim in conversation, remarked aloud, “I've lost!”\\n and closed the door again.\\n\\n“What's he lost?” inquired the American drummer.\\n\\n“Oh, you mustn't mind him,” drawled the Virginian. “He's one of those\\nbox-head jokers goes around openin' and shuttin' doors that-a-way. We\\ncall him harmless. Well,” he broke off, “I reckon I'll go smoke. Not\\nallowed in hyeh?” This last he addressed to the landlady, with especial\\ngentleness. She shook her head, and her eyes followed him as he went\\nout.\\n\\nLeft to myself I meditated for some time upon my lodging for the night,\\nand smoked a cigar for consolation as I walked about. It was not a hotel\\nthat we had supped in. Hotel at Medicine Bow there appeared to be none.\\nBut connected with the eating-house was that place where, according\\nto Steve, the beds were all taken, and there I went to see for myself.\\nSteve had spoken the truth. It was a single apartment containing four or\\nfive beds, and nothing else whatever. And when I looked at these beds,\\nmy sorrow that I could sleep in none of them grew less. To be alone in\\none offered no temptation, and as for this courtesy of the country, this\\ndoubling up--!\\n\\n“Well, they have got ahead of us.” This was the Virginian standing at my\\nelbow.\\n\\nI assented.\\n\\n“They have staked out their claims,” he added.\\n\\nIn this public sleeping room they had done what one does to secure a\\nseat in a railroad train. Upon each bed, as notice of occupancy, lay\\nsome article of travel or of dress. As we stood there, the two Jews came\\nin and opened and arranged their valises, and folded and refolded their\\nlinen dusters. Then a railroad employee entered and began to go to bed\\nat this hour, before dusk had wholly darkened into night. For him, going\\nto bed meant removing his boots and placing his overalls and waistcoat\\nbeneath his pillow. He had no coat. His work began at three in the\\nmorning; and even as we still talked he began to snore.\\n\\n“The man that keeps the store is a friend of mine,” said the Virginian;\\n“and you can be pretty near comfortable on his counter. Got any\\nblankets?”\\n\\nI had no blankets.\\n\\n“Looking for a bed?” inquired the American drummer, now arriving.\\n\\n“Yes, he's looking for a bed,” answered the voice of Steve behind him.\\n\\n“Seems a waste of time,” observed the Virginian. He looked thoughtfully\\nfrom one bed to another. “I didn't know I'd have to lay over here. Well,\\nI have sat up before.”\\n\\n“This one's mine,” said the drummer, sitting down on it. “Half's plenty\\nenough room for me.”\\n\\n“You're cert'nly mighty kind,” said the cow-puncher. “But I'd not think\\no' disconveniencing yu'.”\\n\\n“That's nothing. The other half is yours. Turn in right now if you feel\\nlike it.”\\n\\n“No. I don't reckon I'll turn in right now. Better keep your bed to\\nyourself.”\\n\\n“See here,” urged the drummer, “if I take you I'm safe from drawing some\\nparty I might not care so much about. This here sleeping proposition is\\na lottery.”\\n\\n“Well,” said the Virginian (and his hesitation was truly masterly), “if\\nyou put it that way--”\\n\\n“I do put it that way. Why, you're clean! You've had a shave right now.\\nYou turn in when you feel inclined, old man! I ain't retiring just yet.”\\n\\nThe drummer had struck a slightly false note in these last remarks. He\\nshould not have said “old man.” Until this I had thought him merely an\\namiable person who wished to do a favor. But “old man” came in wrong.\\nIt had a hateful taint of his profession; the being too soon with\\neverybody, the celluloid good-fellowship that passes for ivory with nine\\nin ten of the city crowd. But not so with the sons of the sagebrush.\\nThey live nearer nature, and they know better.\\n\\nBut the Virginian blandly accepted “old man” from his victim: he had a\\ngame to play. “Well, I cert'nly thank yu',” he said. “After a while I'll\\ntake advantage of your kind offer.”\\n\\nI was surprised. Possession being nine points of the law, it seemed\\nhis very chance to intrench himself in the bed. But the cow-puncher\\nhad planned a campaign needing no intrenchments. Moreover, going to bed\\nbefore nine o'clock upon the first evening in many weeks that a town's\\nresources were open to you, would be a dull proceeding. Our entire\\ncompany, drummer and all, now walked over to the store, and here my\\nsleeping arrangements were made easily. This store was the cleanest\\nplace and the best in Medicine Bow, and would have been a good store\\nanywhere, offering a multitude of things for sale, and kept by a very\\ncivil proprietor. He bade me make myself at home, and placed both of his\\ncounters at my disposal. Upon the grocery side there stood a cheese too\\nlarge and strong to sleep near comfortably, and I therefore chose the\\ndry-goods side. Here thick quilts were unrolled for me, to make it soft;\\nand no condition was placed upon me, further than that I should remove\\nmy boots, because the quilts were new, and clean, and for sale. So\\nnow my rest was assured. Not an anxiety remained in my thoughts. These\\ntherefore turned themselves wholly to the other man's bed, and how he\\nwas going to lose it.\\n\\nI think that Steve was more curious even than myself. Time was on the\\nwing. His bet must be decided, and the drinks enjoyed. He stood against\\nthe grocery counter, contemplating the Virginian. But it was to me that\\nhe spoke. The Virginian, however, listened to every word.\\n\\n“Your first visit to this country?”\\n\\nI told him yes.\\n\\n“How do you like it?”\\n\\nI expected to like it very much.\\n\\n“How does the climate strike you?”\\n\\nI thought the climate was fine.\\n\\n“Makes a man thirsty though.”\\n\\nThis was the sub-current which the Virginian plainly looked for. But he,\\nlike Steve, addressed himself to me.\\n\\n“Yes,” he put in, “thirsty while a man's soft yet. You'll harden.”\\n\\n“I guess you'll find it a drier country than you were given to expect,”\\n said Steve.\\n\\n“If your habits have been frequent that way,” said the Virginian.\\n\\n“There's parts of Wyoming,” pursued Steve, “where you'll go hours and\\nhours before you'll see a drop of wetness.”\\n\\n“And if yu' keep a-thinkin' about it,” said the Virginian, “it'll seem\\nlike days and days.”\\n\\nSteve, at this stroke, gave up, and clapped him on the shoulder with a\\njoyous chuckle. “You old son-of-a!” he cried affectionately.\\n\\n“Drinks are due now,” said the Virginian. “My treat, Steve. But I reckon\\nyour suspense will have to linger a while yet.”\\n\\nThus they dropped into direct talk from that speech of the fourth\\ndimension where they had been using me for their telephone.\\n\\n“Any cyards going to-night?” inquired the Virginian.\\n\\n“Stud and draw,” Steve told him. “Strangers playing.”\\n\\n“I think I'd like to get into a game for a while,” said the Southerner.\\n“Strangers, yu' say?”\\n\\nAnd then, before quitting the store, he made his toilet for this little\\nhand at poker. It was a simple preparation. He took his pistol from its\\nholster, examined it, then shoved it between his overalls and his shirt\\nin front, and pulled his waistcoat over it. He might have been combing\\nhis hair for all the attention any one paid to this, except myself. Then\\nthe two friends went out, and I bethought me of that epithet which\\nSteve again had used to the Virginian as he clapped him on the shoulder.\\nClearly this wild country spoke a language other than mine--the word\\nhere was a term of endearment. Such was my conclusion.\\n\\nThe drummers had finished their dealings with the proprietor, and they\\nwere gossiping together in a knot by the door as the Virginian passed\\nout.\\n\\n“See you later, old man!” This was the American drummer accosting his\\nprospective bed-fellow.\\n\\n“Oh, yes,” returned the bed-fellow, and was gone.\\n\\nThe American drummer winked triumphantly at his brethren. “He's all\\nright,” he observed, jerking a thumb after the Virginian. “He's easy.\\nYou got to know him to work him. That's all.”\\n\\n“Und vat is your point?” inquired the German drummer.\\n\\n“Point is--he'll not take any goods off you or me; but he's going to\\ntalk up the killer to any consumptive he runs across. I ain't done with\\nhim yet. Say,” (he now addressed the proprietor), “what's her name?”\\n\\n“Whose name?”\\n\\n“Woman runs the eating-house.”\\n\\n“Glen. Mrs. Glen.”\\n\\n“Ain't she new?”\\n\\n“Been settled here about a month. Husband's a freight conductor.”\\n\\n“Thought I'd not seen her before. She's a good-looker.”\\n\\n“Hm! Yes. The kind of good looks I'd sooner see in another man's wife\\nthan mine.”\\n\\n“So that's the gait, is it?”\\n\\n“Hm! well, it don't seem to be. She come here with that reputation. But\\nthere's been general disappointment.”\\n\\n“Then she ain't lacked suitors any?”\\n\\n“Lacked! Are you acquainted with cow-boys?”\\n\\n“And she disappointed 'em? Maybe she likes her husband?”\\n\\n“Hm! well, how are you to tell about them silent kind?”\\n\\n“Talking of conductors,” began the drummer. And we listened to his\\nanecdote. It was successful with his audience; but when he launched\\nfluently upon a second I strolled out. There was not enough wit in\\nthis narrator to relieve his indecency, and I felt shame at having been\\nsurprised into laughing with him.\\n\\nI left that company growing confidential over their leering stories,\\nand I sought the saloon. It was very quiet and orderly. Beer in quart\\nbottles at a dollar I had never met before; but saving its price, I\\nfound no complaint to make of it. Through folding doors I passed from\\nthe bar proper with its bottles and elk head back to the hall with its\\nvarious tables. I saw a man sliding cards from a case, and across the\\ntable from him another man laying counters down. Near by was a second\\ndealer pulling cards from the bottom of a pack, and opposite him a\\nsolemn old rustic piling and changing coins upon the cards which lay\\nalready exposed.\\n\\nBut now I heard a voice that drew my eyes to the far corner of the room.\\n\\n“Why didn't you stay in Arizona?”\\n\\nHarmless looking words as I write them down here. Yet at the sound of\\nthem I noticed the eyes of the others directed to that corner. What\\nanswer was given to them I did not hear, nor did I see who spoke. Then\\ncame another remark.\\n\\n“Well, Arizona's no place for amatures.”\\n\\nThis time the two card dealers that I stood near began to give a part of\\ntheir attention to the group that sat in the corner. There was in me a\\ndesire to leave this room. So far my hours at Medicine Bow had seemed\\nto glide beneath a sunshine of merriment, of easy-going jocularity. This\\nwas suddenly gone, like the wind changing to north in the middle of a\\nwarm day. But I stayed, being ashamed to go.\\n\\nFive or six players sat over in the corner at a round table where\\ncounters were piled. Their eyes were close upon their cards, and one\\nseemed to be dealing a card at a time to each, with pauses and betting\\nbetween. Steve was there and the Virginian; the others were new faces.\\n\\n“No place for amatures,” repeated the voice; and now I saw that it was\\nthe dealer's. There was in his countenance the same ugliness that his\\nwords conveyed.\\n\\n“Who's that talkin'?” said one of the men near me, in a low voice.\\n\\n“Trampas.”\\n\\n“What's he?”\\n\\n“Cow-puncher, bronco-buster, tin-horn, most anything.”\\n\\n“Who's he talkin' at?”\\n\\n“Think it's the black-headed guy he's talking at.”\\n\\n“That ain't supposed to be safe, is it?”\\n\\n“Guess we're all goin' to find out in a few minutes.”\\n\\n“Been trouble between 'em?”\\n\\n“They've not met before. Trampas don't enjoy losin' to a stranger.”\\n\\n“Fello's from Arizona, yu' say?”\\n\\n“No. Virginia. He's recently back from havin' a look at Arizona. Went\\ndown there last year for a change. Works for the Sunk Creek outfit.” And\\nthen the dealer lowered his voice still further and said something\\nin the other man's ear, causing him to grin. After which both of them\\nlooked at me.\\n\\nThere had been silence over in the corner; but now the man Trampas spoke\\nagain.\\n\\n“AND ten,” said he, sliding out some chips from before him. Very strange\\nit was to hear him, how he contrived to make those words a personal\\ntaunt. The Virginian was looking at his cards. He might have been deaf.\\n\\n“AND twenty,” said the next player, easily.\\n\\nThe next threw his cards down.\\n\\nIt was now the Virginian's turn to bet, or leave the game, and he did\\nnot speak at once.\\n\\nTherefore Trampas spoke. “Your bet, you son-of-a--.”\\n\\nThe Virginian's pistol came out, and his hand lay on the table, holding\\nit unaimed. And with a voice as gentle as ever, the voice that sounded\\nalmost like a caress, but drawling a very little more than usual, so\\nthat there was almost a space between each word, he issued his orders\\nto the man Trampas: “When you call me that, SMILE.” And he looked at\\nTrampas across the table.\\n\\nYes, the voice was gentle. But in my ears it seemed as if somewhere the\\nbell of death was ringing; and silence, like a stroke, fell on the large\\nroom. All men present, as if by some magnetic current, had become aware\\nof this crisis. In my ignorance, and the total stoppage of my thoughts,\\nI stood stock-still, and noticed various people crouching, or shifting\\ntheir positions.\\n\\n“Sit quiet,” said the dealer, scornfully to the man near me. “Can't you\\nsee he don't want to push trouble? He has handed Trampas the choice to\\nback down or draw his steel.”\\n\\nThen, with equal suddenness and ease, the room came out of its\\nstrangeness. Voices and cards, the click of chips, the puff of tobacco,\\nglasses lifted to drink,--this level of smooth relaxation hinted no more\\nplainly of what lay beneath than does the surface tell the depth of the\\nsea.\\n\\nFor Trampas had made his choice. And that choice was not to “draw his\\nsteel.” If it was knowledge that he sought, he had found it, and no\\nmistake! We heard no further reference to what he had been pleased\\nto style “amatures.” In no company would the black-headed man who had\\nvisited Arizona be rated a novice at the cool art of self-preservation.\\n\\nOne doubt remained: what kind of a man was Trampas? A public back-down\\nis an unfinished thing,--for some natures at least. I looked at his\\nface, and thought it sullen, but tricky rather than courageous.\\n\\nSomething had been added to my knowledge also. Once again I had heard\\napplied to the Virginian that epithet which Steve so freely used. The\\nsame words, identical to the letter. But this time they had produced a\\npistol. “When you call me that, SMILE!” So I perceived a new example of\\nthe old truth, that the letter means nothing until the spirit gives it\\nlife.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIII. STEVE TREATS\\n\\n\\nIt was for several minutes, I suppose, that I stood drawing these silent\\nmorals. No man occupied himself with me. Quiet voices, and games of\\nchance, and glasses lifted to drink, continued to be the peaceful order\\nof the night. And into my thoughts broke the voice of that card-dealer\\nwho had already spoken so sagely. He also took his turn at moralizing.\\n\\n“What did I tell you?” he remarked to the man for whom he continued to\\ndeal, and who continued to lose money to him.\\n\\n“Tell me when?”\\n\\n“Didn't I tell you he'd not shoot?” the dealer pursued with complacence.\\n“You got ready to dodge. You had no call to be concerned. He's not the\\nkind a man need feel anxious about.”\\n\\nThe player looked over at the Virginian, doubtfully. “Well,” he said, “I\\ndon't know what you folks call a dangerous man.”\\n\\n“Not him!” exclaimed the dealer with admiration. “He's a brave man.\\nThat's different.”\\n\\nThe player seemed to follow this reasoning no better than I did.\\n\\n“It's not a brave man that's dangerous,” continued the dealer. “It's the\\ncowards that scare me.” He paused that this might sink home.\\n\\n“Fello' came in here las' Toosday,” he went on. “He got into some\\nmisunderstanding about the drinks. Well, sir, before we could put him\\nout of business, he'd hurt two perfectly innocent onlookers. They'd no\\nmore to do with it than you have,” the dealer explained to me.\\n\\n“Were they badly hurt?” I asked.\\n\\n“One of 'em was. He's died since.”\\n\\n“What became of the man?”\\n\\n“Why, we put him out of business, I told you. He died that night. But\\nthere was no occasion for any of it; and that's why I never like to\\nbe around where there's a coward. You can't tell. He'll always go to\\nshooting before it's necessary, and there's no security who he'll\\nhit. But a man like that black-headed guy is (the dealer indicated the\\nVirginian) need never worry you. And there's another point why there's\\nno need to worry about him: IT'D BE TOO LATE.”\\n\\nThese good words ended the moralizing of the dealer. He had given us\\na piece of his mind. He now gave the whole of it to dealing cards.\\nI loitered here and there, neither welcome nor unwelcome at present,\\nwatching the cow-boys at their play. Saving Trampas, there was scarce\\na face among them that had not in it something very likable. Here were\\nlusty horsemen ridden from the heat of the sun, and the wet of the\\nstorm, to divert themselves awhile. Youth untamed sat here for an idle\\nmoment, spending easily its hard-earned wages. City saloons rose into\\nmy vision, and I instantly preferred this Rocky Mountain place. More\\nof death it undoubtedly saw, but less of vice, than did its New York\\nequivalents.\\n\\nAnd death is a thing much cleaner than vice. Moreover, it was by no\\nmeans vice that was written upon these wild and manly faces. Even where\\nbaseness was visible, baseness was not uppermost. Daring, laughter,\\nendurance--these were what I saw upon the countenances of the cow-boys.\\nAnd this very first day of my knowledge of them marks a date with me.\\nFor something about them, and the idea of them, smote my American heart,\\nand I have never forgotten it, nor ever shall, as long as I live. In\\ntheir flesh our natural passions ran tumultuous; but often in their\\nspirit sat hidden a true nobility, and often beneath its unexpected\\nshining their figures took on heroic stature.\\n\\nThe dealer had styled the Virginian “a black-headed guy.” This did well\\nenough as an unflattered portrait. Judge Henry's trustworthy man, with\\nwhom I was to drive two hundred and sixty-three miles, certainly had a\\nvery black head of hair. It was the first thing to notice now, if one\\nglanced generally at the table where he sat at cards. But the eye came\\nback to him--drawn by that inexpressible something which had led the\\ndealer to speak so much at length about him.\\n\\nStill, “black-headed guy” justly fits him and his next performance. He\\nhad made his plan for this like a true and (I must say) inspired devil.\\nAnd now the highly appreciative town of Medicine Bow was to be treated\\nto a manifestation of genius.\\n\\nHe sat playing his stud-poker. After a decent period of losing and\\nwinning, which gave Trampas all proper time for a change of luck and\\na repairing of his fortunes, he looked at Steve and said amiably: “How\\ndoes bed strike you?”\\n\\nI was beside their table, learning gradually that stud-poker has in\\nit more of what I will call red pepper than has our Eastern game. The\\nVirginian followed his own question: “Bed strikes me,” he stated.\\n\\nSteve feigned indifference. He was far more deeply absorbed in his bet\\nand the American drummer than he was in this game; but he chose to take\\nout a fat, florid gold watch, consult it elaborately, and remark, “It's\\nonly eleven.”\\n\\n“Yu' forget I'm from the country,” said the black-headed guy. “The\\nchickens have been roostin' a right smart while.”\\n\\nHis sunny Southern accent was again strong. In that brief passage with\\nTrampas it had been almost wholly absent. But different moods of the\\nspirit bring different qualities of utterance--where a man comes by\\nthese naturally. The Virginian cashed in his checks.\\n\\n“Awhile ago,” said Steve, “you had won three months' salary.”\\n\\n“I'm still twenty dollars to the good,” said the Virginian. “That's\\nbetter than breaking a laig.”\\n\\nAgain, in some voiceless, masonic way, most people in that saloon had\\nbecome aware that something was in process of happening. Several left\\ntheir games and came to the front by the bar.\\n\\n“If he ain't in bed yet--” mused the Virginian.\\n\\n“I'll find out,” said I. And I hurried across to the dim sleeping room,\\nhappy to have a part in this.\\n\\nThey were all in bed; and in some beds two were sleeping. How they could\\ndo it--but in those days I was fastidious. The American had come in\\nrecently and was still awake.\\n\\n“Thought you were to sleep at the store?” said he.\\n\\nSo then I invented a little lie, and explained that I was in search of\\nthe Virginian.\\n\\n“Better search the dives,” said he. “These cow-boys don't get to town\\noften.”\\n\\nAt this point I stumbled sharply over something.\\n\\n“It's my box of Consumption Killer,” explained the drummer; “Well, I\\nhope that man will stay out all night.”\\n\\n“Bed narrow?” I inquired.\\n\\n“For two it is. And the pillows are mean. Takes both before you feel\\nanything's under your head.”\\n\\nHe yawned, and I wished him pleasant dreams.\\n\\nAt my news the Virginian left the bar at once; and crossed to the\\nsleeping room. Steve and I followed softly, and behind us several\\nmore strung out in an expectant line. “What is this going to be?” they\\ninquired curiously of each other. And upon learning the great novelty\\nof the event, they clustered with silence intense outside the door where\\nthe Virginian had gone in.\\n\\nWe heard the voice of the drummer, cautioning his bed-fellow. “Don't\\ntrip over the Killer,” he was saying. “The Prince of Wales barked his\\nshin just now.” It seemed my English clothes had earned me this title.\\n\\nThe boots of the Virginian were next heard to drop.\\n\\n“Can yu' make out what he's at?” whispered Steve.\\n\\nHe was plainly undressing. The rip of swift unbuttoning told us that the\\nblack-headed guy must now be removing his overalls.\\n\\n“Why, thank yu', no,” he was replying to a question of the drummer.\\n“Outside or in's all one to me.”\\n\\n“Then, if you'd just as soon take the wall--”\\n\\n“Why, cert'nly.” There was a sound of bedclothes, and creaking.\\n“This hyeh pillo' needs a Southern climate,” was the Virginian's next\\nobservation.\\n\\nMany listeners had now gathered at the door. The dealer and the player\\nwere both here. The storekeeper was present, and I recognized the agent\\nof the Union Pacific Railroad among the crowd. We made a large company,\\nand I felt that trembling sensation which is common when the cap of a\\ncamera is about to be removed upon a group.\\n\\n“I should think,” said the drummer's voice, “that you'd feel your knife\\nand gun clean through that pillow.”\\n\\n“I do,” responded the Virginian.\\n\\n“I should think you'd put them on a chair and be comfortable.”\\n\\n“I'd be uncomfortable, then.”\\n\\n“Used to the feel of them, I suppose?”\\n\\n“That's it. Used to the feel of them. I would miss them, and that would\\nmake me wakeful.”\\n\\n“Well, good night.”\\n\\n“Good night. If I get to talkin' and tossin', or what not, you'll\\nunderstand you're to--”\\n\\n“Yes, I'll wake you.”\\n\\n“No, don't yu', for God's sake!”\\n\\n“Not?”\\n\\n“Don't yu' touch me.”\\n\\n“What'll I do?”\\n\\n“Roll away quick to your side. It don't last but a minute.” The\\nVirginian spoke with a reassuring drawl.\\n\\nUpon this there fell a brief silence, and I heard the drummer clear his\\nthroat once or twice.\\n\\n“It's merely the nightmare, I suppose?” he said after a throat clearing.\\n\\n“Lord, yes. That's all. And don't happen twice a year. Was you thinkin'\\nit was fits?”\\n\\n“Oh, no! I just wanted to know. I've been told before that it was not\\nsafe for a person to be waked suddenly that way out of a nightmare.”\\n\\n“Yes, I have heard that too. But it never harms me any. I didn't want\\nyou to run risks.”\\n\\n“Me?”\\n\\n“Oh, it'll be all right now that yu' know how it is.” The Virginian's\\ndrawl was full of assurance.\\n\\nThere was a second pause, after which the drummer said:--\\n\\n“Tell me again how it is.”\\n\\nThe Virginian answered very drowsily: “Oh, just don't let your arm or\\nyour laig touch me if I go to jumpin' around. I'm dreamin' of Indians\\nwhen I do that. And if anything touches me then, I'm liable to grab my\\nknife right in my sleep.”\\n\\n“Oh, I understand,” said the drummer, clearing his throat. “Yes.”\\n\\nSteve was whispering delighted oaths to himself, and in his joy applying\\nto the Virginian one unprintable name after another.\\n\\nWe listened again, but now no further words came. Listening very hard,\\nI could half make out the progress of a heavy breathing, and a restless\\nturning I could clearly detect. This was the wretched drummer. He was\\nwaiting. But he did not wait long. Again there was a light creak, and\\nafter it a light step. He was not even going to put his boots on in\\nthe fatal neighborhood of the dreamer. By a happy thought Medicine Bow\\nformed into two lines, making an avenue from the door. And then the\\ncommercial traveller forgot his Consumption Killer. He fell heavily over\\nit.\\n\\nImmediately from the bed the Virginian gave forth a dreadful howl.\\n\\nAnd then everything happened at once; and how shall mere words narrate\\nit? The door burst open, and out flew the commercial traveller in his\\nstockings. One hand held a lump of coat and trousers with suspenders\\ndangling, his boots were clutched in the other. The sight of us stopped\\nhis flight short. He gazed, the boots fell from his hand; and at his\\nprofane explosion, Medicine Bow set up a united, unearthly noise and\\nbegan to play Virginia reel with him. The other occupants of the beds\\nhad already sprung out of them, clothed chiefly with their pistols, and\\nready for war. “What is it?” they demanded. “What is it?”\\n\\n“Why, I reckon it's drinks on Steve,” said the Virginian from his bed.\\nAnd he gave the first broad grin that I had seen from him.\\n\\n“I'll set 'em up all night!” Steve shouted, as the reel went on\\nregardless. The drummer was bawling to be allowed to put at least his\\nboots on. “This way, Pard,” was the answer; and another man whirled him\\nround. “This way, Beau!” they called to him; “This way, Budd!” and\\nhe was passed like a shuttle-cock down the line. Suddenly the leaders\\nbounded into the sleeping-room. “Feed the machine!” they said. “Feed\\nher!” And seizing the German drummer who sold jewellery, they flung him\\ninto the trough of the reel. I saw him go bouncing like an ear of corn\\nto be shelled, and the dance ingulfed him. I saw a Jew sent rattling\\nafter him; and next they threw in the railroad employee, and the other\\nJew; and while I stood mesmerized, my own feet left the earth. I shot\\nfrom the room and sped like a bobbing cork into this mill race, whirling\\nmy turn in the wake of the others amid cries of, “Here comes the Prince\\nof Wales!” There was soon not much English left about my raiment.\\n\\nThey were now shouting for music. Medicine Bow swept in like a cloud of\\ndust to where a fiddler sat playing in a hall; and gathering up fiddler\\nand dancers, swept out again, a larger Medicine Bow, growing all\\nthe while. Steve offered us the freedom of the house, everywhere. He\\nimplored us to call for whatever pleased us, and as many times as we\\nshould please. He ordered the town to be searched for more citizens to\\ncome and help him pay his bet. But changing his mind, kegs and bottles\\nwere now carried along with us. We had found three fiddlers, and these\\nplayed busily for us; and thus we set out to visit all cabins and houses\\nwhere people might still by some miracle be asleep. The first man put\\nout his head to decline. But such a possibility had been foreseen by\\nthe proprietor of the store. This seemingly respectable man now came\\ndragging some sort of apparatus from his place, helped by the Virginian.\\nThe cow-boys cheered, for they knew what this was. The man in his window\\nlikewise recognized it, and uttering a groan, came immediately out and\\njoined us. What it was, I also learned in a few minutes. For we found\\na house where the people made no sign at either our fiddlers or our\\nknocking. And then the infernal machine was set to work. Its parts\\nseemed to be no more than an empty keg and a plank. Some citizen\\ninformed me that I should soon have a new idea of noise; and I nerved\\nmyself for something severe in the way of gunpowder. But the Virginian\\nand the proprietor now sat on the ground holding the keg braced, and two\\nothers got down apparently to play see-saw over the top of it with the\\nplank. But the keg and plank had been rubbed with rosin, and they drew\\nthe plank back and forth over the keg. Do you know the sound made in\\na narrow street by a dray loaded with strips of iron? That noise is a\\nlullaby compared with the staggering, blinding bellow which rose from\\nthe keg. If you were to try it in your native town, you would not merely\\nbe arrested, you would be hanged, and everybody would be glad, and the\\nclergyman would not bury you. My head, my teeth, the whole system of my\\nbones leaped and chattered at the din, and out of the house like drops\\nsquirted from a lemon came a man and his wife. No time was given them.\\nThey were swept along with the rest; and having been routed from their\\nown bed, they now became most furious in assailing the remaining homes\\nof Medicine Bow. Everybody was to come out. Many were now riding horses\\nat top speed out into the plains and back, while the procession of the\\nplank and keg continued its work, and the fiddlers played incessantly.\\n\\nSuddenly there was a quiet. I did not see who brought the message; but\\nthe word ran among us that there was a woman--the engineer's woman\\ndown by the water-tank--very sick. The doctor had been to see her from\\nLaramie. Everybody liked the engineer. Plank and keg were heard no more.\\nThe horsemen found it out and restrained their gambols. Medicine Bow\\nwent gradually home. I saw doors shutting, and lights go out; I saw\\na late few reassemble at the card tables, and the drummers gathered\\nthemselves together for sleep; the proprietor of the store (you could\\nnot see a more respectable-looking person) hoped that I would be\\ncomfortable on the quilts; and I heard Steve urging the Virginian to\\ntake one more glass.\\n\\n“We've not met for so long,” he said.\\n\\nBut the Virginian, the black-headed guy who had set all this nonsense\\ngoing, said No to Steve. “I have got to stay responsible,” was his\\nexcuse to his friend. And the friend looked at me. Therefore I surmised\\nthat the Judge's trustworthy man found me an embarrassment to his\\nholiday. But if he did, he never showed it to me. He had been sent to\\nmeet a stranger and drive him to Sunk Creek in safety, and this charge\\nhe would allow no temptation to imperil. He nodded good night to me. “If\\nthere's anything I can do for yu', you'll tell me.”\\n\\nI thanked him. “What a pleasant evening!” I added.\\n\\n“I'm glad yu' found it so.”\\n\\nAgain his manner put a bar to my approaches. Even though I had seen\\nhim wildly disporting himself, those were matters which he chose not to\\ndiscuss with me.\\n\\nMedicine Bow was quiet as I went my way to my quilts. So still, that\\nthrough the air the deep whistles of the freight trains came from below\\nthe horizon across great miles of silence. I passed cow-boys, whom half\\nan hour before I had seen prancing and roaring, now rolled in their\\nblankets beneath the open and shining night.\\n\\n“What world am I in?” I said aloud. “Does this same planet hold Fifth\\nAvenue?”\\n\\nAnd I went to sleep, pondering over my native land.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIV. DEEP INTO CATTLE LAND\\n\\n\\nMorning had been for some while astir in Medicine Bow before I left my\\nquilts. The new day and its doings began around me in the store, chiefly\\nat the grocery counter. Dry-goods were not in great request. The early\\nrising cow-boys were off again to their work; and those to whom their\\nnight's holiday had left any dollars were spending these for tobacco, or\\ncartridges, or canned provisions for the journey to their distant\\ncamps. Sardines were called for, and potted chicken, and devilled ham:\\na sophisticated nourishment, at first sight, for these sons of the\\nsage-brush. But portable ready-made food plays of necessity a great part\\nin the opening of a new country. These picnic pots and cans were the\\nfirst of her trophies that Civilization dropped upon Wyoming's virgin\\nsoil. The cow-boy is now gone to worlds invisible; the wind has blown\\naway the white ashes of his camp-fires; but the empty sardine box lies\\nrusting over the face of the Western earth.\\n\\nSo through my eyes half closed I watched the sale of these tins, and\\ngrew familiar with the ham's inevitable trademark--that label with the\\ndevil and his horns and hoofs and tail very pronounced, all colored a\\nsultry prodigious scarlet. And when each horseman had made his purchase,\\nhe would trail his spurs over the floor, and presently the sound of his\\nhorse's hoofs would be the last of him. Through my dozing attention came\\nvarious fragments of talk, and sometimes useful bits of knowledge. For\\ninstance, I learned the true value of tomatoes in this country. One\\nfellow was buying two cans of them.\\n\\n“Meadow Creek dry already?” commented the proprietor.\\n\\n“Been dry ten days,” the young cow-boy informed him. And it appeared\\nthat along the road he was going, water would not be reached much before\\nsundown, because this Meadow Creek had ceased to run. His tomatoes were\\nfor drink. And thus they have refreshed me many times since.\\n\\n“No beer?” suggested the proprietor.\\n\\nThe boy made a shuddering face. “Don't say its name to me!” he\\nexclaimed. “I couldn't hold my breakfast down.” He rang his silver money\\nupon the counter. “I've swore off for three months,” he stated. “I'm\\ngoing to be as pure as the snow!” And away he went jingling out of the\\ndoor, to ride seventy-five miles. Three more months of hard, unsheltered\\nwork, and he would ride into town again, with his adolescent blood\\ncrying aloud for its own.\\n\\n“I'm obliged,” said a new voice, rousing me from a new doze. “She's\\neasier this morning, since the medicine.” This was the engineer, whose\\nsick wife had brought a hush over Medicine Bow's rioting. “I'll give her\\nthem flowers soon as she wakes,” he added.\\n\\n“Flowers?” repeated the proprietor.\\n\\n“You didn't leave that bunch at our door?”\\n\\n“Wish I'd thought to do it.”\\n\\n“She likes to see flowers,” said the engineer. And he walked out slowly,\\nwith his thanks unachieved. He returned at once with the Virginian; for\\nin the band of the Virginian's hat were two or three blossoms.\\n\\n“It don't need mentioning,” the Southerner was saying, embarrassed by\\nany expression of thanks. “If we had knowed last night--”\\n\\n“You didn't disturb her any,” broke in the engineer. “She's easier this\\nmorning. I'll tell her about them flowers.”\\n\\n“Why, it don't need mentioning,” the Virginian again protested, almost\\ncrossly. “The little things looked kind o' fresh, and I just picked\\nthem.” His eye now fell upon me, where I lay upon the counter. “I reckon\\nbreakfast will be getting through,” he remarked.\\n\\nI was soon at the wash trough. It was only half-past six, but many had\\nbeen before me,--one glance at the roller-towel told me that. I was\\nafraid to ask the landlady for a clean one, and so I found a fresh\\nhandkerchief, and accomplished a sparing toilet. In the midst of this\\nthe drummers joined me, one by one, and they used the degraded towel\\nwithout hesitation. In a way they had the best of me; filth was nothing\\nto them.\\n\\nThe latest risers in Medicine Bow, we sat at breakfast together; and\\nthey essayed some light familiarities with the landlady. But these\\nexperiments were failures. Her eyes did not see, nor did her ears\\nhear them. She brought the coffee and the bacon with a sedateness that\\npropriety itself could scarce have surpassed. Yet impropriety lurked\\nnoiselessly all over her. You could not have specified how; it was\\ninterblended with her sum total. Silence was her apparent habit and her\\nweapon; but the American drummer found that she could speak to the point\\nwhen need came for this. During the meal he had praised her golden\\nhair. It was golden indeed, and worth a high compliment; but his kind\\ndispleased her. She had let it pass, however, with no more than a cool\\nstare. But on taking his leave, when he came to pay for the meal, he\\npushed it too far.\\n\\n“Pity this must be our last,” he said; and as it brought no answer,\\n“Ever travel?” he inquired. “Where I go, there's room for a pair of us.”\\n\\n“Then you'd better find another jackass,” she replied quietly.\\n\\nI was glad that I had not asked for a clean towel.\\n\\nFrom the commercial travellers I now separated myself, and wandered\\nalone in pleasurable aimlessness. It was seven o'clock. Medicine\\nBow stood voiceless and unpeopled. The cow-boys had melted away. The\\ninhabitants were indoors, pursuing the business or the idleness of the\\nforenoon. Visible motion there was none. No shell upon the dry sands\\ncould lie more lifeless than Medicine Bow. Looking in at the store,\\nI saw the proprietor sitting with his pipe extinct. Looking in at the\\nsaloon, I saw the dealer dealing dumbly to himself. Up in the sky there\\nwas not a cloud nor a bird, and on the earth the lightest straw\\nlay becalmed. Once I saw the Virginian at an open door, where the\\ngolden-haired landlady stood talking with him. Sometimes I strolled in\\nthe town, and sometimes out on the plain I lay down with my day dreams\\nin the sagebrush. Pale herds of antelope were in the distance, and near\\nby the demure prairie-dogs sat up and scrutinized me. Steve, Trampas,\\nthe riot of horsemen, my lost trunk, Uncle Hughey, with his abortive\\nbrides--all things merged in my thoughts in a huge, delicious\\nindifference. It was like swimming slowly at random in an ocean that was\\nsmooth, and neither too cool nor too warm. And before I knew it, five\\nlazy imperceptible hours had gone thus. There was the Union Pacific\\ntrain, coming as if from shores forgotten.\\n\\nIts approach was silent and long drawn out. I easily reached town and\\nthe platform before it had finished watering at the tank. It moved up,\\nmade a short halt, I saw my trunk come out of it, and then it moved away\\nsilently as it had come, smoking and dwindling into distance unknown.\\n\\nBeside my trunk was one other, tied extravagantly with white ribbon. The\\nfluttering bows caught my attention, and now I suddenly saw a perfectly\\nnew sight. The Virginian was further down the platform, doubled up with\\nlaughing. It was good to know that with sufficient cause he could laugh\\nlike this; a smile had thus far been his limit of external mirth.\\nRice now flew against my hat, and hissing gusts of rice spouted on the\\nplatform. All the men left in Medicine Bow appeared like magic, and more\\nrice choked the atmosphere. Through the general clamor a cracked voice\\nsaid, “Don't hit her in the eye, boys!” and Uncle Hughey rushed proudly\\nby me with an actual wife on his arm. She could easily have been his\\ngranddaughter. They got at once into a vehicle. The trunk was lifted in\\nbehind. And amid cheers, rice, shoes, and broad felicitations, the pair\\ndrove out of town, Uncle Hughey shrieking to the horses and the bride\\nwaving unabashed adieus.\\n\\nThe word had come over the wires from Laramie: “Uncle Hughey has made\\nit this time. Expect him on to-day's number two.” And Medicine Bow had\\nexpected him.\\n\\nMany words arose on the departure of the new-married couple.\\n\\n“Who's she?”\\n\\n“What's he got for her?”\\n\\n“Got a gold mine up Bear Creek.”\\n\\nAnd after comment and prophecy, Medicine Bow returned to its dinner.\\n\\nThis meal was my last here for a long while. The Virginian's\\nresponsibility now returned; duty drove the Judge's trustworthy man\\nto take care of me again. He had not once sought my society of his own\\naccord; his distaste for what he supposed me to be (I don't exactly know\\nwhat this was) remained unshaken. I have thought that matters of dress\\nand speech should not carry with them so much mistrust in our democracy;\\nthieves are presumed innocent until proved guilty, but a starched collar\\nis condemned at once. Perfect civility and obligingness I certainly did\\nreceive from the Virginian, only not a word of fellowship. He harnessed\\nthe horses, got my trunk, and gave me some advice about taking\\nprovisions for our journey, something more palatable than what food we\\nshould find along the road. It was well thought of, and I bought quite a\\nparcel of dainties, feeling that he would despise both them and me. And\\nthus I took my seat beside him, wondering what we should manage to talk\\nabout for two hundred and sixty-three miles.\\n\\nFarewell in those days was not said in Cattle Land. Acquaintances\\nwatched our departure with a nod or with nothing, and the nearest\\napproach to “Good-by” was the proprietor's “So-long.” But I caught sight\\nof one farewell given without words.\\n\\nAs we drove by the eating-house, the shade of a side window was raised,\\nand the landlady looked her last upon the Virginian. Her lips were\\nfaintly parted, and no woman's eyes ever said more plainly, “I am one of\\nyour possessions.” She had forgotten that it might be seen. Her glance\\ncaught mine, and she backed into the dimness of the room. What look\\nshe may have received from him, if he gave her any at this too public\\nmoment, I could not tell. His eyes seemed to be upon the horses, and\\nhe drove with the same mastering ease that had roped the wild pony\\nyesterday. We passed the ramparts of Medicine Bow,--thick heaps and\\nfringes of tin cans, and shelving mounds of bottles cast out of the\\nsaloons. The sun struck these at a hundred glittering points. And in a\\nmoment we were in the clean plains, with the prairie-dogs and the pale\\nherds of antelope. The great, still air bathed us, pure as water and\\nstrong as wine; the sunlight flooded the world; and shining upon the\\nbreast of the Virginian's flannel shirt lay a long gold thread of hair!\\nThe noisy American drummer had met defeat, but this silent free lance\\nhad been easily victorious.\\n\\nIt must have been five miles that we travelled in silence, losing and\\nseeing the horizon among the ceaseless waves of the earth. Then I looked\\nback, and there was Medicine Bow, seemingly a stone's throw behind\\nus. It was a full half-hour before I looked back again, and there sure\\nenough was always Medicine Bow. A size or two smaller, I will admit, but\\nvisible in every feature, like something seen through the wrong end of\\na field glass. The East-bound express was approaching the town, and I\\nnoticed the white steam from its whistle; but when the sound reached us,\\nthe train had almost stopped. And in reply to my comment upon this, the\\nVirginian deigned to remark that it was more so in Arizona.\\n\\n“A man come to Arizona,” he said, “with one of them telescopes to study\\nthe heavenly bodies. He was a Yankee, seh, and a right smart one, too.\\nAnd one night we was watchin' for some little old fallin' stars that he\\nsaid was due, and I saw some lights movin' along across the mesa pretty\\nlively, an' I sang out. But he told me it was just the train. And I told\\nhim I didn't know yu' could see the cyars that plain from his place,\\n'Yu' can see them,' he said to me, 'but it is las' night's cyars you're\\nlookin' at.'” At this point the Virginian spoke severely to one of the\\nhorses. “Of course,” he then resumed to me, “that Yankee man did not\\nmean quite all he said.--You, Buck!” he again broke off suddenly to\\nthe horse. “But Arizona, seh,” he continued, “it cert'nly has a mos'\\ndeceivin' atmospheah. Another man told me he had seen a lady close one\\neye at him when he was two minutes hard run from her.” This time the\\nVirginian gave Buck the whip.\\n\\n“What effect,” I inquired with a gravity equal to his own, “does this\\nextraordinary foreshortening have upon a quart of whiskey?”\\n\\n“When it's outside yu', seh, no distance looks too far to go to it.”\\n\\nHe glanced at me with an eye that held more confidence than hitherto he\\nhad been able to feel in me. I had made one step in his approval. But\\nI had many yet to go. This day he preferred his own thoughts to my\\nconversation, and so he did all the days of this first journey; while\\nI should have greatly preferred his conversation to my thoughts. He\\ndismissed some attempts that I made upon the subject of Uncle Hughey so\\nthat I had not the courage to touch upon Trampas, and that chill brief\\ncollision which might have struck the spark of death. Trampas! I had\\nforgotten him till this silent drive I was beginning. I wondered if I\\nshould ever see him, or Steve, or any of those people again. And this\\nwonder I expressed aloud.\\n\\n“There's no tellin' in this country,” said the Virginian. “Folks come\\neasy, and they go easy. In settled places, like back in the States, even\\na poor man mostly has a home. Don't care if it's only a barrel on a lot,\\nthe fello' will keep frequentin' that lot, and if yu' want him yu' can\\nfind him. But out hyeh in the sage-brush, a man's home is apt to be his\\nsaddle blanket. First thing yu' know, he has moved it to Texas.”\\n\\n“You have done some moving yourself,” I suggested.\\n\\nBut this word closed his mouth. “I have had a look at the country,” he\\nsaid, and we were silent again. Let me, however, tell you here that he\\nhad set out for a “look at the country” at the age of fourteen; and\\nthat by his present age of twenty-four he had seen Arkansas, Texas,\\nNew Mexico, Arizona, California, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming.\\nEverywhere he had taken care of himself, and survived; nor had his\\nstrong heart yet waked up to any hunger for a home. Let me also tell you\\nthat he was one of thousands drifting and living thus, but (as you shall\\nlearn) one in a thousand.\\n\\nMedicine Bow did not forever remain in sight. When next I thought of it\\nand looked behind, nothing was there but the road we had come; it lay\\nlike a ship's wake across the huge ground swell of the earth. We were\\nswallowed in a vast solitude. A little while before sunset, a cabin came\\nin view; and here we passed our first night. Two young men lived here,\\ntending their cattle. They were fond of animals. By the stable a chained\\ncoyote rushed nervously in a circle, or sat on its haunches and snapped\\nat gifts of food ungraciously. A tame young elk walked in and out of\\nthe cabin door, and during supper it tried to push me off my chair. A\\nhalf-tame mountain sheep practised jumping from the ground to the roof.\\nThe cabin was papered with posters of a circus, and skins of bear and\\nsilver fox lay upon the floor. Until nine o'clock one man talked to the\\nVirginian, and one played gayly upon a concertina; and then we all went\\nto bed. The air was like December, but in my blankets and a buffalo robe\\nI kept warm, and luxuriated in the Rocky Mountain silence. Going to wash\\nbefore breakfast at sunrise, I found needles of ice in a pail. Yet it\\nwas hard to remember that this quiet, open, splendid wilderness (with\\nnot a peak in sight just here) was six thousand feet high. And when\\nbreakfast was over there was no December left; and by the time the\\nVirginian and I were ten miles upon our way, it was June. But always\\nevery breath that I breathed was pure as water and strong as wine.\\n\\nWe never passed a human being this day. Some wild cattle rushed up to\\nus and away from us; antelope stared at us from a hundred yards; coyotes\\nran skulking through the sage-brush to watch us from a hill; at our noon\\nmeal we killed a rattlesnake and shot some young sage chickens, which\\nwere good at supper, roasted at our camp-fire.\\n\\nBy half-past eight we were asleep beneath the stars, and by half-past\\nfour I was drinking coffee and shivering. The horse, Buck, was hard to\\ncatch this second morning. Whether some hills that we were now in\\nhad excited him, or whether the better water up here had caused an\\neffervescence in his spirits, I cannot say. But I was as hot as July by\\nthe time we had him safe in harness, or, rather, unsafe in harness. For\\nBuck, in the mysterious language of horses, now taught wickedness to\\nhis side partner, and about eleven o'clock they laid their evil heads\\ntogether and decided to break our necks.\\n\\nWe were passing, I have said, through a range of demi-mountains. It was\\na little country where trees grew, water ran, and the plains were shut\\nout for a while. The road had steep places in it, and places here and\\nthere where you could fall off and go bounding to the bottom among\\nstones. But Buck, for some reason, did not think these opportunities\\ngood enough for him. He selected a more theatrical moment. We emerged\\nfrom a narrow canyon suddenly upon five hundred cattle and some cow-boys\\nbranding calves by a fire in a corral. It was a sight that Buck knew by\\nheart. He instantly treated it like an appalling phenomenon. I saw\\nhim kick seven ways; I saw Muggins kick five ways; our furious motion\\nsnapped my spine like a whip. I grasped the seat. Something gave a\\nforlorn jingle. It was the brake.\\n\\n“Don't jump!” commanded the trustworthy man.\\n\\n“No,” I said, as my hat flew off.\\n\\nHelp was too far away to do anything for us. We passed scatheless through\\na part of the cattle, I saw their horns and backs go by. Some earth\\ncrumbled, and we plunged downward into water rocking among stones, and\\nupward again through some more crumbling earth. I heard a crash, and saw\\nmy trunk landing in the stream.\\n\\n“She's safer there,” said the trustworthy man.\\n\\n“True,” I said.\\n\\n“We'll go back for her,” said he, with his eye on the horses and his\\nfoot on the crippled brake. A dry gully was coming, and no room to turn.\\nThe farther side of it was terraced with rock. We should simply fall\\nbackward, if we did not fall forward first. He steered the horses\\nstraight over, and just at the bottom swung them, with astonishing\\nskill, to the right along the hard-baked mud. They took us along the bed\\nup to the head of the gully, and through a thicket of quaking asps. The\\nlight trees bent beneath our charge and bastinadoed the wagon as it went\\nover them. But their branches enmeshed the horses' legs, and we came to\\na harmless standstill among a bower of leaves.\\n\\nI looked at the trustworthy man, and smiled vaguely. He considered me\\nfor a moment.\\n\\n“I reckon,” said he, “you're feelin' about halfway between 'Oh, Lord!'\\nand 'Thank God!'”\\n\\n“That's quite it,” said I, as he got down on the ground.\\n\\n“Nothing's broke,” said he, after a searching examination. And he\\nindulged in a true Virginian expletive. “Gentlemen, hush!” he murmured\\ngently, looking at me with his grave eyes; “one time I got pretty near\\nscared. You, Buck,” he continued, “some folks would beat you now till\\nyu'd be uncertain whether yu' was a hawss or a railroad accident. I'd do\\nit myself, only it wouldn't cure yu'.”\\n\\nI now told him that I supposed he had saved both our lives. But he\\ndetested words of direct praise. He made some grumbling rejoinder, and\\nled the horses out of the thicket. Buck, he explained to me, was a good\\nhorse, and so was Muggins. Both of them generally meant well, and that\\nwas the Judge's reason for sending them to meet me. But these broncos\\nhad their off days. Off days might not come very often; but when the\\nhumor seized a bronco, he had to have his spree. Buck would now behave\\nhimself as a horse should for probably two months. “They are just like\\nhumans,” the Virginian concluded.\\n\\nSeveral cow-boys arrived on a gallop to find how many pieces of us were\\nleft. We returned down the hill; and when we reached my trunk, it was\\nsurprising to see the distance that our runaway had covered. My hat was\\nalso found, and we continued on our way.\\n\\nBuck and Muggins were patterns of discretion through the rest of the\\nmountains. I thought when we camped this night that it was strange Buck\\nshould be again allowed to graze at large, instead of being tied to a\\nrope while we slept. But this was my ignorance. With the hard work that\\nhe was gallantly doing, the horse needed more pasture than a rope's\\nlength would permit him to find. Therefore he went free, and in the\\nmorning gave us but little trouble in catching him.\\n\\nWe crossed a river in the forenoon, and far to the north of us we saw\\nthe Bow Leg Mountains, pale in the bright sun. Sunk Creek flowed from\\ntheir western side, and our two hundred and sixty-three miles began to\\ngrow a small thing in my eyes. Buck and Muggins, I think, knew perfectly\\nthat to-morrow would see them home. They recognized this region; and\\nonce they turned off at a fork in the road. The Virginian pulled them\\nback rather sharply.\\n\\n“Want to go back to Balaam's?” he inquired of them. “I thought you had\\nmore sense.”\\n\\nI asked, “Who was Balaam?”\\n\\n“A maltreater of hawsses,” replied the cow-puncher. “His ranch is on\\nButte Creek oveh yondeh.” And he pointed to where the diverging road\\nmelted into space. “The Judge bought Buck and Muggins from him in the\\nspring.”\\n\\n“So he maltreats horses?” I repeated.\\n\\n“That's the word all through this country. A man that will do what\\nthey claim Balaam does to a hawss when he's mad, ain't fit to be called\\nhuman.” The Virginian told me some particulars.\\n\\n“Oh!” I almost screamed at the horror of it, and again, “Oh!”\\n\\n“He'd have prob'ly done that to Buck as soon as he stopped runnin' away.\\nIf I caught a man doin' that--”\\n\\nWe were interrupted by a sedate-looking traveller riding upon an equally\\nsober horse.\\n\\n“Mawnin', Taylor,” said the Virginian, pulling up for gossip. “Ain't you\\nstrayed off your range pretty far?”\\n\\n“You're a nice one!” replied Mr. Taylor, stopping his horse and smiling\\namiably.\\n\\n“Tell me something I don't know,” retorted the Virginian.\\n\\n“Hold up a man at cards and rob him,” pursued Mr. Taylor. “Oh, the news\\nhas got ahead of you!”\\n\\n“Trampas has been hyeh explainin', has he?” said the Virginian with a\\ngrin.\\n\\n“Was that your victim's name?” said Mr. Taylor, facetiously. “No, it\\nwasn't him that brought the news. Say, what did you do, anyway?”\\n\\n“So that thing has got around,” murmured the Virginian. “Well, it wasn't\\nworth such wide repawtin'.” And he gave the simple facts to Taylor,\\nwhile I sat wondering at the contagious powers of Rumor. Here, through\\nthis voiceless land, this desert, this vacuum, it had spread like a\\nchange of weather. “Any news up your way?” the Virginian concluded.\\n\\nImportance came into Mr. Taylor's countenance. “Bear Creek is going to\\nbuild a schoolhouse,” said he.\\n\\n“Goodness gracious!” drawled the Virginian. “What's that for?”\\n\\nNow Mr. Taylor had been married for some years. “To educate the\\noffspring of Bear Creek,” he answered with pride.\\n\\n“Offspring of Bear Creek,” the Virginian meditatively repeated. “I don't\\nremember noticin' much offspring. There was some white tail deer, and a\\nright smart o' jack rabbits.”\\n\\n“The Swintons have moved up from Drybone,” said Mr. Taylor, always\\nseriously. “They found it no place for young children. And there's Uncle\\nCarmody with six, and Ben Dow. And Westfall has become a family man,\\nand--”\\n\\n“Jim Westfall!” exclaimed the Virginian. “Him a fam'ly man! Well, if\\nthis hyeh Territory is goin' to get full o' fam'ly men and empty o'\\ngame, I believe I'll--”\\n\\n“Get married yourself,” suggested Mr. Taylor.\\n\\n“Me! I ain't near reached the marriageable age. No, seh! But Uncle\\nHughey has got there at last, yu' know.”\\n\\n“Uncle Hughey!” shouted Mr. Taylor. He had not heard this. Rumor is very\\ncapricious. Therefore the Virginian told him, and the family man rocked\\nin his saddle.\\n\\n“Build your schoolhouse,” said the Virginian. “Uncle Hughey has\\nqualified himself to subscribe to all such propositions. Got your eye on\\na schoolmarm?”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nV. ENTER THE WOMAN\\n\\n\\n“We are taking steps,” said Mr. Taylor. “Bear Creek ain't going to be\\nhasty about a schoolmarm.”\\n\\n“Sure,” assented the Virginian. “The children wouldn't want yu' to\\nhurry.”\\n\\nBut Mr. Taylor was, as I have indicated, a serious family man. The\\nproblem of educating his children could appear to him in no light except\\na sober one. “Bear Creek,” he said, “don't want the experience they had\\nover at Calef. We must not hire an ignoramus.”\\n\\n“Sure!” assented the Virginian again.\\n\\n“Nor we don't want no gad-a-way flirt,” said Mr. Taylor.\\n\\n“She must keep her eyes on the blackboa'd,” said the Virginian, gently.\\n\\n“Well, we can wait till we get a guaranteed article,” said Mr. Taylor.\\n“And that's what we're going to do. It can't be this year, and it\\nneedn't to be. None of the kids is very old, and the schoolhouse has got\\nto be built.” He now drew a letter from his pocket, and looked at me.\\n“Are you acquainted with Miss Mary Stark Wood of Bennington, Vermont?”\\n he inquired.\\n\\nI was not acquainted with her at this time.\\n\\n“She's one we are thinking of. She's a correspondent with Mrs. Balaam.”\\n Taylor handed me the letter. “She wrote that to Mrs. Balaam, and Mrs.\\nBalaam said the best thing was for to let me see it and judge for\\nmyself. I'm taking it back to Mrs. Balaam. Maybe you can give me your\\nopinion how it sizes up with the letters they write back East?”\\n\\nThe communication was mainly of a business kind, but also personal,\\nand freely written. I do not think that its writer expected it to be\\nexhibited as a document. The writer wished very much that she could see\\nthe West. But she could not gratify this desire merely for pleasure,\\nor she would long ago have accepted the kind invitation to visit Mrs.\\nBalaam's ranch. Teaching school was something she would like to do, if\\nshe were fitted for it. “Since the mills failed” (the writer said) “we\\nhave all gone to work and done a lot of things so that mother might keep\\non living in the old house. Yes, the salary would be a temptation. But,\\nmy dear, isn't Wyoming bad for the complexion? And could I sue them if\\nmine got damaged? It is still admired. I could bring one male witness AT\\nLEAST to prove that!” Then the writer became businesslike again. Even if\\nshe came to feel that she could leave home, she did not at all know that\\nshe could teach school. Nor did she think it right to accept a\\nposition in which one had had no experience. “I do love children, boys\\nespecially,” she went on. “My small nephew and I get on famously. But\\nimagine if a whole benchful of boys began asking me questions that I\\ncouldn't answer! What should I do? For one could not spank them all,\\nyou know! And mother says that I ought not to teach anybody spelling,\\nbecause I leave the U out of HONOR.”\\n\\nAltogether it was a letter which I could assure Mr. Taylor “sized up”\\n very well with the letters written in my part of the United States. And\\nit was signed, “Your very sincere spinster, Molly Stark Wood.”\\n\\n“I never seen HONOR spelled with a U,” said Mr. Taylor, over whose not\\nhighly civilized head certain portions of the letter had lightly passed.\\n\\nI told him that some old-fashioned people still wrote the word so.\\n\\n“Either way would satisfy Bear Creek,” said Mr. Taylor, “if she's\\notherwise up to requirements.”\\n\\nThe Virginian was now looking over the letter musingly, and with\\nawakened attention.\\n\\n“'Your very sincere spinster,'” he read aloud slowly.\\n\\n“I guess that means she's forty,” said Taylor.\\n\\n“I reckon she is about twenty,” said the Virginian. And again he fell to\\nmusing over the paper that he held.\\n\\n“Her handwriting ain't like any I've saw,” pursued Mr. Taylor. “But Bear\\nCreek would not object to that, provided she knows 'rithmetic and George\\nWashington, and them kind of things.”\\n\\n“I expect she is not an awful sincere spinster,” surmised the Virginian,\\nstill looking at the letter, still holding it as if it were some token.\\n\\nHas any botanist set down what the seed of love is? Has it anywhere been\\nset down in how many ways this seed may be sown? In what various vessels\\nof gossamer it can float across wide spaces? Or upon what different\\nsoils it can fall, and live unknown, and bide its time for blooming?\\n\\nThe Virginian handed back to Taylor the sheet of note paper where a girl\\nhad talked as the women he had known did not talk. If his eyes had\\never seen such maidens, there had been no meeting of eyes; and if such\\nmaidens had ever spoken to him, the speech was from an established\\ndistance. But here was a free language, altogether new to him. It\\nproved, however, not alien to his understanding, as it was alien to Mr.\\nTaylor's.\\n\\nWe drove onward, a mile perhaps, and then two. He had lately been full\\nof words, but now he barely answered me, so that a silence fell upon\\nboth of us. It must have been all of ten miles that we had driven when\\nhe spoke of his own accord.\\n\\n“Your real spinster don't speak of her lot that easy,” he remarked. And\\npresently he quoted a phrase about the complexion, “'Could I sue them\\nif mine got damaged?'” and he smiled over this to himself, shaking\\nhis head. “What would she be doing on Bear Creek?” he next said. And\\nfinally: “I reckon that witness will detain her in Vermont. And her\\nmother'll keep livin' at the old house.”\\n\\nThus did the cow-puncher deliver himself, not knowing at all that the\\nseed had floated across wide spaces, and was biding its time in his\\nheart.\\n\\nOn the morrow we reached Sunk Creek. Judge Henry's welcome and his\\nwife's would have obliterated any hardships that I had endured, and I\\nhad endured none at all.\\n\\nFor a while I saw little of the Virginian. He lapsed into his native way\\nof addressing me occasionally as “seh”--a habit entirely repudiated by\\nthis land of equality. I was sorry. Our common peril during the runaway\\nof Buck and Muggins had brought us to a familiarity that I hoped was\\ndestined to last. But I think that it would not have gone farther,\\nsave for a certain personage--I must call her a personage. And as I am\\nindebted to her for gaining me a friend whose prejudice against me might\\nnever have been otherwise overcome, I shall tell you her little story,\\nand how her misadventures and her fate came to bring the Virginian and\\nme to an appreciation of one another. Without her, it is likely I should\\nalso not have heard so much of the story of the schoolmarm, and how that\\nlady at last came to Bear Creek.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVI. EM'LY\\n\\n\\nMy personage was a hen, and she lived at the Sunk Creek Ranch.\\n\\nJudge Henry's ranch was notable for several luxuries. He had milk, for\\nexample. In those days his brother ranchmen had thousands of cattle very\\noften, but not a drop of milk, save the condensed variety. Therefore\\nthey had no butter. The Judge had plenty. Next rarest to butter and milk\\nin the cattle country were eggs. But my host had chickens. Whether this\\nwas because he had followed cock-fighting in his early days, or whether\\nit was due to Mrs. Henry, I cannot say. I only know that when I took a\\nmeal elsewhere, I was likely to find nothing but the eternal “sowbelly,”\\n beans, and coffee; while at Sunk Creek the omelet and the custard were\\nfrequent. The passing traveller was glad to tie his horse to the fence\\nhere, and sit down to the Judge's table. For its fame was as wide as\\nWyoming. It was an oasis in the Territory's desolate bill-of-fare.\\n\\nThe long fences of Judge Henry's home ranch began upon Sunk Creek soon\\nafter that stream emerged from its canyon through the Bow Leg. It was\\na place always well cared for by the owner, even in the days of his\\nbachelorhood. The placid regiments of cattle lay in the cool of the\\ncottonwoods by the water, or slowly moved among the sage-brush, feeding\\nupon the grass that in those forever departed years was plentiful and\\ntall. The steers came fat off his unenclosed range and fattened still\\nmore in his large pasture; while his small pasture, a field some eight\\nmiles square, was for several seasons given to the Judge's horses, and\\nover this ample space there played and prospered the good colts which\\nhe raised from Paladin, his imported stallion. After he married, I have\\nbeen assured that his wife's influence became visible in and about the\\nhouse at once. Shade trees were planted, flowers attempted, and to the\\nchickens was added the much more troublesome turkey. I, the visitor, was\\npressed into service when I arrived, green from the East. I took hold of\\nthe farmyard and began building a better chicken house, while the Judge\\nwas off creating meadow land in his gray and yellow wilderness. When\\nany cow-boy was unoccupied, he would lounge over to my neighborhood, and\\nsilently regard my carpentering.\\n\\nThose cow-punchers bore names of various denominations. There was Honey\\nWiggin; there was Nebrasky, and Dollar Bill, and Chalkeye. And they came\\nfrom farms and cities, from Maine and from California. But the romance\\nof American adventure had drawn them all alike to this great playground\\nof young men, and in their courage, their generosity, and their\\namusement at me they bore a close resemblance to each other. Each one\\nwould silently observe my achievements with the hammer and the chisel.\\nThen he would retire to the bunk-house, and presently I would overhear\\nlaughter. But this was only in the morning. In the afternoon on many\\ndays of the summer which I spent at the Sunk Creek Ranch I would go\\nshooting, or ride up toward the entrance of the canyon and watch the men\\nworking on the irrigation ditches. Pleasant systems of water running\\nin channels were being led through the soil, and there was a sound of\\nrippling here and there among the yellow grain; the green thick alfalfa\\ngrass waved almost, it seemed, of its own accord, for the wind never\\nblew; and when at evening the sun lay against the plain, the rift of the\\ncanyon was filled with a violet light, and the Bow Leg Mountains became\\ntransfigured with hues of floating and unimaginable color. The sun shone\\nin a sky where never a cloud came, and noon was not too warm nor the\\ndark too cool. And so for two months I went through these pleasant\\nuneventful days, improving the chickens, an object of mirth, living in\\nthe open air, and basking in the perfection of content.\\n\\nI was justly styled a tenderfoot. Mrs. Henry had in the beginning\\nendeavored to shield me from this humiliation; but when she found that I\\nwas inveterate in laying my inexperience of Western matters bare to all\\nthe world, begging to be enlightened upon rattlesnakes, prairie-dogs,\\nowls, blue and willow grouse, sage-hens, how to rope a horse or tighten\\nthe front cinch of my saddle, and that my spirit soared into enthusiasm\\nat the mere sight of so ordinary an animal as a white-tailed deer, she\\nlet me rush about with my firearms and made no further effort to stave\\noff the ridicule that my blunders perpetually earned from the ranch\\nhands, her own humorous husband, and any chance visitor who stopped for\\na meal or stayed the night.\\n\\nI was not called by my name after the first feeble etiquette due to a\\nstranger in his first few hours had died away. I was known simply as\\n“the tenderfoot.” I was introduced to the neighborhood (a circle\\nof eighty miles) as “the tenderfoot.” It was thus that Balaam, the\\nmaltreater of horses, learned to address me when he came a two\\ndays' journey to pay a visit. And it was this name and my notorious\\nhelplessness that bid fair to end what relations I had with the\\nVirginian. For when Judge Henry ascertained that nothing could prevent\\nme from losing myself, that it was not uncommon for me to saunter out\\nafter breakfast with a gun and in thirty minutes cease to know north\\nfrom south, he arranged for my protection. He detailed an escort for me;\\nand the escort was once more the trustworthy man! The poor Virginian was\\ntaken from his work and his comrades and set to playing nurse for me.\\nAnd for a while this humiliation ate into his untamed soul. It was his\\nlugubrious lot to accompany me in my rambles, preside over my blunders,\\nand save me from calamitously passing into the next world. He bore it in\\ncourteous silence, except when speaking was necessary. He would show me\\nthe lower ford, which I could never find for myself, generally mistaking\\na quicksand for it. He would tie my horse properly. He would recommend\\nme not to shoot my rifle at a white-tailed deer in the particular moment\\nthat the outfit wagon was passing behind the animal on the further side\\nof the brush. There was seldom a day that he was not obliged to hasten\\nand save me from sudden death or from ridicule, which is worse. Yet\\nnever once did he lose his patience and his gentle, slow voice, and\\napparently lazy manner remained the same, whether we were sitting at\\nlunch together, or up in the mountain during a hunt, or whether he\\nwas bringing me back my horse, which had run away because I had again\\nforgotten to throw the reins over his head and let them trail.\\n\\n“He'll always stand if yu' do that,” the Virginian would say. “See how\\nmy hawss stays right quiet yondeh.”\\n\\nAfter such admonition he would say no more to me. But this tame\\nnursery business was assuredly gall to him. For though utterly a man\\nin countenance and in his self-possession and incapacity to be put at\\na loss, he was still boyishly proud of his wild calling, and wore his\\nleather straps and jingled his spurs with obvious pleasure. His tiger\\nlimberness and his beauty were rich with unabated youth; and that force\\nwhich lurked beneath his surface must often have curbed his intolerance\\nof me. In spite of what I knew must be his opinion of me, the\\ntenderfoot, my liking for him grew, and I found his silent company more\\nand more agreeable. That he had spells of talking, I had already learned\\nat Medicine Bow. But his present taciturnity might almost have effaced\\nthis impression, had I not happened to pass by the bunk-house one\\nevening after dark, when Honey Wiggin and the rest of the cow-boys were\\ngathered inside it.\\n\\nThat afternoon the Virginian and I had gone duck shooting. We had\\nfound several in a beaver dam, and I had killed two as they sat close\\ntogether; but they floated against the breastwork of sticks out in the\\nwater some four feet deep, where the escaping current might carry them\\ndown the stream. The Judge's red setter had not accompanied us, because\\nshe was expecting a family.\\n\\n“We don't want her along anyways,” the cow-puncher had explained to me.\\n“She runs around mighty irresponsible, and she'll stand a prairie-dog\\n'bout as often as she'll stand a bird. She's a triflin' animal.”\\n\\nMy anxiety to own the ducks caused me to pitch into the water with\\nall my clothes on, and subsequently crawl out a slippery, triumphant,\\nweltering heap. The Virginian's serious eyes had rested upon this\\nspectacle of mud; but he expressed nothing, as usual.\\n\\n“They ain't overly good eatin',” he observed, tying the birds to his\\nsaddle. “They're divers.”\\n\\n“Divers!” I exclaimed. “Why didn't they dive?”\\n\\n“I reckon they was young ones and hadn't experience.”\\n\\n“Well,” I said, crestfallen, but attempting to be humorous, “I did the\\ndiving myself.”\\n\\nBut the Virginian made no comment. He handed me my double-barrelled\\nEnglish gun, which I was about to leave deserted on the ground\\nbehind me, and we rode home in our usual silence, the mean little\\nwhite-breasted, sharp-billed divers dangling from his saddle.\\n\\nIt was in the bunk-house that he took his revenge. As I passed I heard\\nhis gentle voice silently achieving some narrative to an attentive\\naudience, and just as I came by the open window where he sat on his bed\\nin shirt and drawers, his back to me, I heard his concluding words,\\n“And the hat on his haid was the one mark showed yu' he weren't a\\nsnappin'-turtle.”\\n\\nThe anecdote met with instantaneous success, and I hurried away into the\\ndark. The next morning I was occupied with the chickens. Two hens were\\nfighting to sit on some eggs that a third was daily laying, and which\\nI did not want hatched, and for the third time I had kicked Em'ly off\\nseven potatoes she had rolled together and was determined to raise I\\nknow not what sort of family from. She was shrieking about the hen-house\\nas the Virginian came in to observe (I suspect) what I might be doing\\nnow that could be useful for him to mention in the bunk-house.\\n\\nHe stood awhile, and at length said, “We lost our best rooster when Mrs.\\nHenry came to live hyeh.”\\n\\nI paid no attention.\\n\\n“He was a right elegant Dominicker,” he continued.\\n\\nI felt a little riled about the snapping-turtle, and showed no interest\\nin what he was saying, but continued my functions among the hens. This\\nunusual silence of mine seemed to elicit unusual speech from him.\\n\\n“Yu' see, that rooster he'd always lived round hyeh when the Judge was\\na bachelor, and he never seen no ladies or any persons wearing female\\ngyarments. You ain't got rheumatism, seh?”\\n\\n“Me? No.”\\n\\n“I reckoned maybe them little odd divers yu' got damp goin' afteh--” He\\npaused.\\n\\n“Oh, no, not in the least, thank you.”\\n\\n“Yu' seemed sort o' grave this mawnin', and I'm cert'nly glad it ain't\\nthem divers.”\\n\\n“Well, the rooster?” I inquired finally.\\n\\n“Oh, him! He weren't raised where he could see petticoats. Mrs. Henry\\nshe come hyeh from the railroad with the Judge afteh dark. Next mawnin'\\nearly she walked out to view her new home, and the rooster was a-feedin'\\nby the door, and he seen her. Well, seh, he screeched that awful I run\\nout of the bunk-house; and he jus' went over the fence and took down\\nSunk Creek shoutin' fire, right along. He has never come back.”\\n\\n“There's a hen over there now that has no judgment,” I said, indicating\\nEm'ly. She had got herself outside the house, and was on the bars of a\\ncorral, her vociferations reduced to an occasional squawk. I told him\\nabout the potatoes.\\n\\n“I never knowed her name before,” said he. “That runaway rooster, he\\nhated her. And she hated him same as she hates 'em all.”\\n\\n“I named her myself,” said I, “after I came to notice her particularly.\\nThere's an old maid at home who's charitable, and belongs to the Cruelty\\nto Animals, and she never knows whether she had better cross in front\\nof a street car or wait. I named the hen after her. Does she ever lay\\neggs?”\\n\\nThe Virginian had not “troubled his haid” over the poultry.\\n\\n“Well, I don't believe she knows how. I think she came near being a\\nrooster.”\\n\\n“She's sure manly-lookin',” said the Virginian. We had walked toward the\\ncorral, and he was now scrutinizing Em'ly with interest.\\n\\nShe was an egregious fowl. She was huge and gaunt, with great yellow\\nbeak, and she stood straight and alert in the manner of responsible\\npeople. There was something wrong with her tail. It slanted far to\\none side, one feather in it twice as long as the rest. Feathers on her\\nbreast there were none. These had been worn entirely off by her habit of\\nsitting upon potatoes and other rough abnormal objects. And this lent\\nto her appearance an air of being decollete, singularly at variance\\nwith her otherwise prudish ensemble. Her eye was remarkably bright, but\\nsomehow it had an outraged expression. It was as if she went about the\\nworld perpetually scandalized over the doings that fell beneath her\\nnotice. Her legs were blue, long, and remarkably stout.\\n\\n“She'd ought to wear knickerbockers,” murmured the Virginian. “She'd\\nlook a heap better 'n some o' them college students. And she'll set on\\npotatoes, yu' say?”\\n\\n“She thinks she can hatch out anything. I've found her with onions, and\\nlast Tuesday I caught her on two balls of soap.”\\n\\nIn the afternoon the tall cow-puncher and I rode out to get an antelope.\\n\\nAfter an hour, during which he was completely taciturn, he said: “I\\nreckon maybe this hyeh lonesome country ain't been healthy for Em'ly to\\nlive in. It ain't for some humans. Them old trappers in the mountains\\ngets skewed in the haid mighty often, an' talks out loud when nobody's\\nnigher 'n a hundred miles.”\\n\\n“Em'ly has not been solitary,” I replied. “There are forty chickens\\nhere.”\\n\\n“That's so,” said he. “It don't explain her.”\\n\\nHe fell silent again, riding beside me, easy and indolent in the saddle.\\nHis long figure looked so loose and inert that the swift, light spring\\nhe made to the ground seemed an impossible feat. He had seen an antelope\\nwhere I saw none.\\n\\n“Take a shot yourself,” I urged him, as he motioned me to be quick. “You\\nnever shoot when I'm with you.”\\n\\n“I ain't hyeh for that,” he answered. “Now you've let him get away on\\nyu'!”\\n\\nThe antelope had in truth departed.\\n\\n“Why,” he said to my protest, “I can hit them things any day. What's\\nyour notion as to Em'ly?”\\n\\n“I can't account for her,” I replied.\\n\\n“Well,” he said musingly, and then his mind took one of those particular\\nturns that made me love him, “Taylor ought to see her. She'd be just the\\nschoolmarm for Bear Creek!”\\n\\n“She's not much like the eating-house lady at Medicine Bow,” I said.\\n\\nHe gave a hilarious chuckle. “No, Em'ly knows nothing o' them joys. So\\nyu' have no notion about her? Well, I've got one. I reckon maybe she was\\nhatched after a big thunderstorm.”\\n\\n“In a big thunderstorm!” I exclaimed.\\n\\n“Yes. Don't yu' know about them, and what they'll do to aiggs? A\\nbig case o' lightnin' and thunder will addle aiggs and keep 'em from\\nhatchin'. And I expect one came along, and all the other aiggs of\\nEm'ly's set didn't hatch out, but got plumb addled, and she happened not\\nto get addled that far, and so she just managed to make it through. But\\nshe cert'nly ain't got a strong haid.”\\n\\n“I fear she has not,” said I.\\n\\n“Mighty hon'ble intentions,” he observed. “If she can't make out to lay\\nanything, she wants to hatch somethin', and be a mother anyways.”\\n\\n“I wonder what relation the law considers that a hen is to the chicken\\nshe hatched but did not lay?” I inquired.\\n\\nThe Virginian made no reply to this frivolous suggestion. He was gazing\\nover the wide landscape gravely and with apparent inattention. He\\ninvariably saw game before I did, and was off his horse and crouched\\namong the sage while I was still getting my left foot clear of the\\nstirrup. I succeeded in killing an antelope, and we rode home with the\\nhead and hind quarters.\\n\\n“No,” said he. “It's sure the thunder, and not the lonesomeness. How do\\nyu' like the lonesomeness yourself?”\\n\\nI told him that I liked it.\\n\\n“I could not live without it now,” he said. “This has got into my\\nsystem.” He swept his hand out at the vast space of world. “I went back\\nhome to see my folks onced. Mother was dyin' slow, and she wanted me.\\nI stayed a year. But them Virginia mountains could please me no more.\\nAfteh she was gone, I told my brothers and sisters good-by. We like each\\nother well enough, but I reckon I'll not go back.”\\n\\nWe found Em'ly seated upon a collection of green California peaches,\\nwhich the Judge had brought from the railroad.\\n\\n“I don't mind her any more,” I said; “I'm sorry for her.”\\n\\n“I've been sorry for her right along,” said the Virginian. “She does\\nhate the roosters so.” And he said that he was making a collection of\\nevery class of object which he found her treating as eggs.\\n\\nBut Em'ly's egg-industry was terminated abruptly one morning, and her\\nunquestioned energies diverted to a new channel. A turkey which had been\\nsitting in the root-house appeared with twelve children, and a family of\\nbantams occurred almost simultaneously. Em'ly was importantly scratching\\nthe soil inside Paladin's corral when the bantam tribe of newly born\\ncame by down the lane, and she caught sight of them through the bars.\\nShe crossed the corral at a run, and intercepted two of the chicks that\\nwere trailing somewhat behind their real mamma. These she undertook\\nto appropriate, and assumed a high tone with the bantam, who was the\\nsmaller, and hence obliged to retreat with her still numerous family.\\nI interfered, and put matters straight; but the adjustment was only\\ntemporary. In an hour I saw Em'ly immensely busy with two more bantams,\\nleading them about and taking a care of them which I must admit seemed\\nperfectly efficient.\\n\\nAnd now came the first incident that made me suspect her to be demented.\\n\\nShe had proceeded with her changelings behind the kitchen, where one of\\nthe irrigation ditches ran under the fence from the hay-field to supply\\nthe house with water. Some distance along this ditch inside the field\\nwere the twelve turkeys in the short, recently cut stubble. Again Em'ly\\nset off instantly like a deer. She left the dismayed bantams behind her.\\nShe crossed the ditch with one jump of her stout blue legs, flew over\\nthe grass, and was at once among the turkeys, where, with an instinct\\nof maternity as undiscriminating as it was reckless, she attempted to\\nhuddle some of them away. But this other mamma was not a bantam, and in\\na few moments Em'ly was entirely routed in her attempt to acquire a new\\nvariety of family.\\n\\nThis spectacle was witnessed by the Virginian and myself, and it\\novercame him. He went speechless across to the bunk-house, by himself,\\nand sat on his bed, while I took the abandoned bantams back to their own\\ncircle.\\n\\nI have often wondered what the other fowls thought of all this. Some\\nimpression it certainly did make upon them. The notion may seem out of\\nreason to those who have never closely attended to other animals than\\nman; but I am convinced that any community which shares some of our\\ninstincts will share some of the resulting feelings, and that birds and\\nbeasts have conventions, the breach of which startles them. If there be\\nanything in evolution, this would seem inevitable. At all events,\\nthe chicken-house was upset during the following several days. Em'ly\\ndisturbed now the bantams and now the turkeys, and several of these\\nlatter had died, though I will not go so far as to say that this was\\nthe result of her misplaced attentions. Nevertheless, I was seriously\\nthinking of locking her up till the broods should be a little older,\\nwhen another event happened, and all was suddenly at peace.\\n\\nThe Judge's setter came in one morning, wagging her tail. She had had\\nher puppies, and she now took us to where they were housed, in between\\nthe floor of a building and the hollow ground. Em'ly was seated on the\\nwhole litter.\\n\\n“No,” I said to the Judge, “I am not surprised. She is capable of\\nanything.”\\n\\nIn her new choice of offspring, this hen had at length encountered an\\nunworthy parent. The setter was bored by her own puppies. She found the\\nhole under the house an obscure and monotonous residence compared with\\nthe dining room, and our company more stimulating and sympathetic than\\nthat of her children. A much-petted contact with our superior race had\\ndeveloped her dog intelligence above its natural level, and turned her\\ninto an unnatural, neglectful mother, who was constantly forgetting her\\nnursery for worldly pleasures.\\n\\nAt certain periods of the day she repaired to the puppies and fed them,\\nbut came away when this perfunctory ceremony was accomplished; and she\\nwas glad enough to have a governess bring them up. She made no quarrel\\nwith Em'ly, and the two understood each other perfectly. I have never\\nseen among animals any arrangement so civilized and so perverted.\\nIt made Em'ly perfectly happy. To see her sitting all day jealously\\nspreading her wings over some blind puppies was sufficiently curious;\\nbut when they became large enough to come out from under the house and\\ntoddle about in the proud hen's wake, I longed for some distinguished\\nnaturalist. I felt that our ignorance made us inappropriate spectators\\nof such a phenomenon. Em'ly scratched and clucked, and the puppies ran\\nto her, pawed her with their fat limp little legs, and retreated beneath\\nher feathers in their games of hide and seek. Conceive, if you can, what\\nconfusion must have reigned in their infant minds as to who the setter\\nwas!\\n\\n“I reckon they think she's the wet-nurse,” said the Virginian.\\n\\nWhen the puppies grew to be boisterous, I perceived that Em'ly's\\nmission was approaching its end. They were too heavy for her, and their\\nincreasing scope of playfulness was not in her line. Once or twice they\\nknocked her over, upon which she arose and pecked them severely, and\\nthey retired to a safe distance, and sitting in a circle, yapped at\\nher. I think they began to suspect that she was only a hen after all.\\nSo Em'ly resigned with an indifference which surprised me, until I\\nremembered that if it had been chickens, she would have ceased to look\\nafter them by this time.\\n\\nBut here she was again “out of a job,” as the Virginian said.\\n\\n“She's raised them puppies for that triflin' setter, and now she'll\\nbe huntin' around for something else useful to do that ain't in her\\nbusiness.”\\n\\nNow there were other broods of chickens to arrive in the hen-house, and\\nI did not desire any more bantam and turkey performances. So, to avoid\\nconfusion, I played a trick upon Em'ly. I went down to Sunk Creek and\\nfetched some smooth, oval stones. She was quite satisfied with these,\\nand passed a quiet day with them in a box. This was not fair, the\\nVirginian asserted.\\n\\n“You ain't going to jus' leave her fooled that a-way?”\\n\\nI did not see why not.\\n\\n“Why, she raised them puppies all right. Ain't she showed she knows how\\nto be a mother anyways? Em'ly ain't going to get her time took up for\\nnothing while I'm round hyeh,” said the cow-puncher.\\n\\nHe laid a gentle hold of Em'ly and tossed her to the ground. She, of\\ncourse, rushed out among the corrals in a great state of nerves.\\n\\n“I don't see what good you do meddling,” I protested.\\n\\nTo this he deigned no reply, but removed the unresponsive stones from\\nthe straw.\\n\\n“Why, if they ain't right warm!” he exclaimed plaintively. “The poor,\\ndeluded son-of-a-gun!” And with this unusual description of a lady, he\\nsent the stones sailing like a line of birds. “I'm regular getting stuck\\non Em'ly,” continued the Virginian. “Yu' needn't to laugh. Don't yu' see\\nshe's got sort o' human feelin's and desires? I always knowed hawsses\\nwas like people, and my collie, of course. It is kind of foolish, I\\nexpect, but that hen's goin' to have a real aigg di-rectly, right now,\\nto set on.” With this he removed one from beneath another hen. “We'll\\nhave Em'ly raise this hyeh,” said he, “so she can put in her time\\nprofitable.”\\n\\nIt was not accomplished at once; for Em'ly, singularly enough, would\\nnot consent to stay in the box whence she had been routed. At length we\\nfound another retreat for her, and in these new surroundings, with a\\nnew piece of work for her to do, Em'ly sat on the one egg which the\\nVirginian had so carefully provided for her.\\n\\nThus, as in all genuine tragedies, was the stroke of Fate wrought by\\nchance and the best intentions.\\n\\nEm'ly began sitting on Friday afternoon near sundown. Early next morning\\nmy sleep was gradually dispersed by a sound unearthly and continuous.\\nNow it dwindled, receding to a distance; again it came near, took a\\nturn, drifted to the other side of the house; then, evidently, whatever\\nit was, passed my door close, and I jumped upright in my bed. The high,\\ntense strain of vibration, nearly, but not quite, a musical note, was\\nlike the threatening scream of machinery, though weaker, and I bounded\\nout of the house in my pajamas.\\n\\nThere was Em'ly, dishevelled, walking wildly about, her one egg\\nmiraculously hatched within ten hours. The little lonely yellow ball of\\ndown went cheeping along behind, following its mother as best it could.\\nWhat, then, had happened to the established period of incubation? For\\nan instant the thing was like a portent, and I was near joining Em'ly in\\nher horrid surprise, when I saw how it all was. The Virginian had taken\\nan egg from a hen which had already been sitting for three weeks.\\n\\nI dressed in haste, hearing Em'ly's distracted outcry. It steadily\\nsounded, without perceptible pause for breath, and marked her erratic\\njourney back and forth through stables, lanes, and corrals. The shrill\\ndisturbance brought all of us out to see her, and in the hen-house I\\ndiscovered the new brood making its appearance punctually.\\n\\nBut this natural explanation could not be made to the crazed hen. She\\ncontinued to scour the premises, her slant tail and its one preposterous\\nfeather waving as she aimlessly went, her stout legs stepping high with\\nan unnatural motion, her head lifted nearly off her neck, and in\\nher brilliant yellow eye an expression of more than outrage at\\nthis overturning of a natural law. Behind her, entirely ignored and\\nneglected, trailed the little progeny. She never looked at it. We went\\nabout our various affairs, and all through the clear, sunny day that\\nunending metallic scream pervaded the premises. The Virginian put out\\nfood and water for her, but she tasted nothing. I am glad to say that\\nthe little chicken did. I do not think that the hen's eyes could see,\\nexcept in the way that sleep-walkers' do.\\n\\nThe heat went out of the air, and in the canyon the violet light began\\nto show. Many hours had gone, but Em'ly never ceased. Now she suddenly\\nflew up in a tree and sat there with her noise still going; but it had\\nrisen lately several notes into a slim, acute level of terror, and was\\nnot like machinery any more, nor like any sound I ever heard before or\\nsince. Below the tree stood the bewildered little chicken, cheeping, and\\nmaking tiny jumps to reach its mother.\\n\\n“Yes,” said the Virginian, “it's comical. Even her aigg acted different\\nfrom anybody else's.” He paused, and looked across the wide, mellowing\\nplain with the expression of easy-going gravity so common with him. Then\\nhe looked at Em'ly in the tree and the yellow chicken.\\n\\n“It ain't so damned funny,” said he.\\n\\nWe went in to supper, and I came out to find the hen lying on the\\nground, dead. I took the chicken to the family in the hen-house.\\n\\nNo, it was not altogether funny any more. And I did not think less of\\nthe Virginian when I came upon him surreptitiously digging a little hole\\nin the field for her.\\n\\n“I have buried some citizens here and there,” said he, “that I have\\nrespected less.”\\n\\nAnd when the time came for me to leave Sunk Creek, my last word to the\\nVirginian was, “Don't forget Em'ly.”\\n\\n“I ain't likely to,” responded the cow-puncher. “She is just one o' them\\nparables.”\\n\\nSave when he fell into his native idioms (which, they told me, his\\nwanderings had well-nigh obliterated until that year's visit to his home\\nagain revived them in his speech), he had now for a long while dropped\\nthe “seh,” and all other barriers between us. We were thorough friends,\\nand had exchanged many confidences both of the flesh and of the spirit.\\nHe even went the length of saying that he would write me the Sunk Creek\\nnews if I would send him a line now and then. I have many letters from\\nhim now. Their spelling came to be faultless, and in the beginning was\\nlittle worse than George Washington's.\\n\\nThe Judge himself drove me to the railroad by another way--across the\\nBow Leg Mountains, and south through Balaam's Ranch and Drybone to Rock\\nCreek.\\n\\n“I'll be very homesick,” I told him.\\n\\n“Come and pull the latch-string whenever you please,” he bade me. I\\nwished that I might! No lotus land ever cast its spell upon man's heart\\nmore than Wyoming had enchanted mine.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVII. THROUGH TWO SNOWS\\n\\n\\n“Dear Friend [thus in the spring the Virginian wrote me], Yours\\nreceived. It must be a poor thing to be sick. That time I was shot at\\nCanada de Oro would have made me sick if it had been a littel lower or\\nif I was much of a drinking man. You will be well if you give over city\\nlife and take a hunt with me about August or say September for then the\\nelk will be out of the velvett.\\n\\n“Things do not please me here just now and I am going to settel it\\nby vamosing. But I would be glad to see you. It would be pleasure not\\nbusiness for me to show you plenty elk and get you strong. I am not\\ncrybabying to the Judge or making any kick about things. He will want\\nme back after he has swallowed a litter tincture of time. It is the best\\ndose I know.\\n\\n“Now to answer your questions. Yes the Emmily hen might have ate loco\\nweed if hens do. I never saw anything but stock and horses get poisoned\\nwith loco weed. No the school is not built yet. They are always big\\ntalkers on Bear Creek. No I have not seen Steve. He is around but I\\nam sorry for him. Yes I have been to Medicine Bow. I had the welcom I\\nwanted. Do you remember a man I played poker and he did not like it? He\\nis working on the upper ranch near Ten Sleep. He does not amount to a\\nthing except with weaklings. Uncle Hewie has twins. The boys got him\\nvexed some about it, but I think they are his. Now that is all I know\\nto-day and I would like to see you poco presently as they say at Los\\nCruces. There's no sense in you being sick.”\\n\\nThe rest of this letter discussed the best meeting point for us should I\\ndecide to join him for a hunt.\\n\\nThat hunt was made, and during the weeks of its duration something was\\nsaid to explain a little more fully the Virginian's difficulty at the\\nSunk Creek Ranch, and his reason for leaving his excellent employer the\\nJudge. Not much was said, to be sure; the Virginian seldom spent many\\nwords upon his own troubles. But it appeared that owing to some jealousy\\nof him on the part of the foreman, or the assistant foreman, he found\\nhimself continually doing another man's work, but under circumstances so\\nskilfully arranged that he got neither credit nor pay for it. He would\\nnot stoop to telling tales out of school. Therefore his ready and\\nprophetic mind devised the simple expedient of going away altogether.\\nHe calculated that Judge Henry would gradually perceive there was a\\nconnection between his departure and the cessation of the satisfactory\\nwork. After a judicious interval it was his plan to appear again in the\\nneighborhood of Sunk Creek and await results.\\n\\nConcerning Steve he would say no more than he had written. But it was\\nplain that for some cause this friendship had ceased.\\n\\nMoney for his services during the hunt he positively declined to accept,\\nasserting that he had not worked enough to earn his board. And the\\nexpedition ended in an untravelled corner of the Yellowstone Park,\\nnear Pitchstone Canyon, where he and young Lin McLean and others\\nwere witnesses of a sad and terrible drama that has been elsewhere\\nchronicled.\\n\\nHis prophetic mind had foreseen correctly the shape of events at Sunk\\nCreek. The only thing that it had not foreseen was the impression to be\\nmade upon the Judge's mind by his conduct.\\n\\nToward the close of that winter, Judge and Mrs. Henry visited the East.\\nThrough them a number of things became revealed. The Virginian was back\\nat Sunk Creek.\\n\\n“And,” said Mrs. Henry, “he would never have left you if I had had my\\nway, Judge H.!”\\n\\n“No, Madam Judge,” retorted her husband; “I am aware of that. For you\\nhave always appreciated a fine appearance in a man.”\\n\\n“I certainly have,” confessed the lady, mirthfully. “And the way he\\nused to come bringing my horse, with the ridges of his black hair so\\ncarefully brushed and that blue spotted handkerchief tied so effectively\\nround his throat, was something that I missed a great deal after he went\\naway.”\\n\\n“Thank you, my dear, for this warning. I have plans that will keep him\\nabsent quite constantly for the future.”\\n\\nAnd then they spoke less flightily. “I always knew,” said the lady,\\n“that you had found a treasure when that man came.”\\n\\nThe Judge laughed. “When it dawned on me,” he said, “how cleverly he\\ncaused me to learn the value of his services by depriving me of them, I\\ndoubted whether it was safe to take him back.”\\n\\n“Safe!” cried Mrs. Henry.\\n\\n“Safe, my dear. Because I'm afraid he is pretty nearly as shrewd as I\\nam. And that's rather dangerous in a subordinate.” The Judge laughed\\nagain. “But his action regarding the man they call Steve has made me\\nfeel easy.”\\n\\nAnd then it came out that the Virginian was supposed to have discovered\\nin some way that Steve had fallen from the grace of that particular\\nhonesty which respects another man's cattle. It was not known for\\ncertain. But calves had begun to disappear in Cattle Land, and cows had\\nbeen found killed. And calves with one brand upon them had been found\\nwith mothers that bore the brand of another owner. This industry was\\ntaking root in Cattle Land, and of those who practised it, some were\\nbeginning to be suspected. Steve was not quite fully suspected yet. But\\nthat the Virginian had parted company with him was definitely known. And\\nneither man would talk about it.\\n\\nThere was the further news that the Bear Creek schoolhouse at length\\nstood complete, floor, walls, and roof; and that a lady from Bennington,\\nVermont, a friend of Mrs. Balaam's, had quite suddenly decided that she\\nwould try her hand at instructing the new generation.\\n\\nThe Judge and Mrs. Henry knew this because Mrs. Balaam had told them\\nof her disappointment that she would be absent from the ranch on Butte\\nCreek when her friend arrived, and therefore unable to entertain her.\\nThe friend's decision had been quite suddenly made, and must form the\\nsubject of the next chapter.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVIII. THE SINCERE SPINSTER\\n\\n\\nI do not know with which of the two estimates--Mr. Taylor's or the\\nVirginian's--you agreed. Did you think that Miss Mary Stark Wood of\\nBennington, Vermont, was forty years of age? That would have been an\\nerror. At the time she wrote the letter to Mrs. Balaam, of which\\nletter certain portions have been quoted in these pages, she was in\\nher twenty-first year; or, to be more precise, she had been twenty some\\neight months previous.\\n\\nNow, it is not usual for young ladies of twenty to contemplate a journey\\nof nearly two thousand miles to a country where Indians and wild animals\\nlive unchained, unless they are to make such journey in company with a\\nprotector, or are going to a protector's arms at the other end. Nor is\\nschool teaching on Bear Creek a usual ambition for such young ladies.\\n\\nBut Miss Mary Stark Wood was not a usual young lady for two reasons.\\n\\nFirst, there was her descent. Had she so wished, she could have belonged\\nto any number of those patriotic societies of which our American ears\\nhave grown accustomed to hear so much. She could have been enrolled in\\nthe Boston Tea Party, the Ethan Allen Ticonderogas, the Green Mountain\\nDaughters, the Saratoga Sacred Circle, and the Confederated Colonial\\nChatelaines. She traced direct descent from the historic lady whose name\\nshe bore, that Molly Stark who was not a widow after the battle where\\nher lord, her Captain John, battled so bravely as to send his name\\nthrilling down through the blood of generations of schoolboys. This\\nancestress was her chief claim to be a member of those shining societies\\nwhich I have enumerated. But she had been willing to join none of them,\\nalthough invitations to do so were by no means lacking. I cannot tell\\nyou her reason. Still, I can tell you this. When these societies were\\nmuch spoken of in her presence, her very sprightly countenance became\\nmore sprightly, and she added her words of praise or respect to the\\ngeneral chorus. But when she received an invitation to join one of\\nthese bodies, her countenance, as she read the missive, would assume an\\nexpression which was known to her friends as “sticking her nose in the\\nair.” I do not think that Molly's reason for refusing to join could have\\nbeen a truly good one. I should add that her most precious possession--a\\ntreasure which accompanied her even if she went away for only one\\nnight's absence--was an heirloom, a little miniature portrait of the old\\nMolly Stark, painted when that far-off dame must have been scarce more\\nthan twenty. And when each summer the young Molly went to Dunbarton, New\\nHampshire, to pay her established family visit to the last survivors of\\nher connection who bore the name of Stark, no word that she heard in the\\nDunbarton houses pleased her so much as when a certain great-aunt would\\ntake her by the hand, and, after looking with fond intentness at her,\\npronounce: “My dear, you're getting more like the General's wife every\\nyear you live.”\\n\\n“I suppose you mean my nose,” Molly would then reply.\\n\\n“Nonsense, child. You have the family length of nose, and I've never\\nheard that it has disgraced us.”\\n\\n“But I don't think I'm tall enough for it.”\\n\\n“There now, run to your room, and dress for tea. The Starks have always\\nbeen punctual.”\\n\\nAnd after this annual conversation, Molly would run to her room, and\\nthere in its privacy, even at the risk of falling below the punctuality\\nof the Starks, she would consult two objects for quite a minute before\\nshe began to dress. These objects, as you have already correctly\\nguessed, were the miniature of the General's wife and the looking glass.\\n\\nSo much for Miss Molly Stark Wood's descent.\\n\\nThe second reason why she was not a usual girl was her character. This\\ncharacter was the result of pride and family pluck battling with family\\nhardship.\\n\\nJust one year before she was to be presented to the world--not the great\\nmetropolitan world, but a world that would have made her welcome and\\ndone her homage at its little dances and little dinners in Troy and\\nRutland and Burlington--fortune had turned her back upon the Woods.\\nTheir possessions had never been great ones; but they had sufficed. From\\ngeneration to generation the family had gone to school like gentlefolk,\\ndressed like gentlefolk, used the speech and ways of gentlefolk, and as\\ngentlefolk lived and died. And now the mills failed.\\n\\nInstead of thinking about her first evening dress, Molly found pupils\\nto whom she could give music lessons. She found handkerchiefs that she\\ncould embroider with initials. And she found fruit that she could\\nmake into preserves. That machine called the typewriter was then in\\nexistence, but the day of women typewriters had as yet scarcely begun\\nto dawn, else I think Molly would have preferred this occupation to the\\nhandkerchiefs and the preserves.\\n\\nThere were people in Bennington who “wondered how Miss Wood could go\\nabout from house to house teaching the piano, and she a lady.” There\\nalways have been such people, I suppose, because the world must always\\nhave a rubbish heap. But we need not dwell upon them further than to\\nmention one other remark of theirs regarding Molly. They all with one\\nvoice declared that Sam Bannett was good enough for anybody who did\\nfancy embroidery at five cents a letter.\\n\\n“I dare say he had a great-grandmother quite as good as hers,” remarked\\nMrs. Flynt, the wife of the Baptist minister.\\n\\n“That's entirely possible,” returned the Episcopal rector of Hoosic,\\n“only we don't happen to know who she was.” The rector was a friend of\\nMolly's. After this little observation, Mrs. Flynt said no more, but\\ncontinued her purchases in the store where she and the rector had\\nhappened to find themselves together. Later she stated to a friend that\\nshe had always thought the Episcopal Church a snobbish one, and now she\\nknew it.\\n\\nSo public opinion went on being indignant over Molly's conduct. She\\ncould stoop to work for money, and yet she pretended to hold herself\\nabove the most rising young man in Hoosic Falls, and all just because\\nthere was a difference in their grandmothers!\\n\\nWas this the reason at the bottom of it? The very bottom? I cannot be\\ncertain, because I have never been a girl myself. Perhaps she thought\\nthat work is not a stooping, and that marriage may be. Perhaps--But all\\nI really know is that Molly Wood continued cheerfully to embroider\\nthe handkerchiefs, make the preserves, teach the pupils--and firmly to\\nreject Sam Bannett.\\n\\nThus it went on until she was twenty. There certain members of her\\nfamily began to tell her how rich Sam was going to be--was, indeed,\\nalready. It was at this time that she wrote Mrs. Balaam her doubts and\\nher desires as to migrating to Bear Creek. It was at this time also\\nthat her face grew a little paler, and her friends thought that she was\\noverworked, and Mrs. Flynt feared she was losing her looks. It was at\\nthis time, too, that she grew very intimate with that great-aunt over at\\nDunbarton, and from her received much comfort and strengthening.\\n\\n“Never!” said the old lady, “especially if you can't love him.”\\n\\n“I do like him,” said Molly; “and he is very kind.”\\n\\n“Never!” said the old lady again. “When I die, you'll have\\nsomething--and that will not be long now.”\\n\\nMolly flung her arms around her aunt, and stopped her words with a kiss.\\nAnd then one winter afternoon, two years later, came the last straw.\\n\\nThe front door of the old house had shut. Out of it had stepped the\\npersistent suitor. Mrs. Flynt watched him drive away in his smart\\nsleigh.\\n\\n“That girl is a fool!” she said furiously; and she came away from her\\nbedroom window where she had posted herself for observation.\\n\\nInside the old house a door had also shut. This was the door of Molly's\\nown room. And there she sat, in floods of tears. For she could not bear\\nto hurt a man who loved her with all the power of love that was in him.\\n\\nIt was about twilight when her door opened, and an elderly lady came\\nsoftly in.\\n\\n“My dear,” she ventured, “and you were not able--”\\n\\n“Oh, mother!” cried the girl, “have you come to say that too?”\\n\\nThe next day Miss Wood had become very hard. In three weeks she\\nhad accepted the position on Bear Creek. In two months she started,\\nheart-heavy, but with a spirit craving the unknown.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIX. THE SPINSTER MEETS THE UNKNOWN\\n\\n\\nOn a Monday noon a small company of horsemen strung out along the trail\\nfrom Sunk Creek to gather cattle over their allotted sweep of range.\\nSpring was backward, and they, as they rode galloping and gathering\\nupon the cold week's work, cursed cheerily and occasionally sang. The\\nVirginian was grave in bearing and of infrequent speech; but he kept\\na song going--a matter of some seventy-nine verses. Seventy-eight were\\nquite unprintable, and rejoiced his brother cow-punchers monstrously.\\nThey, knowing him to be a singular man, forebore ever to press him, and\\nawaited his own humor, lest he should weary of the lyric; and when after\\na day of silence apparently saturnine, he would lift his gentle voice\\nand begin:\\n\\n     “If you go to monkey with my Looloo girl,\\n      I'll tell you what I'll do:\\n      I'll cyarve your heart with my razor, AND\\n      I'll shoot you with my pistol, too--”\\n\\nthen they would stridently take up each last line, and keep it going\\nthree, four, ten times, and kick holes in the ground to the swing of it.\\n\\nBy the levels of Bear Creek that reach like inlets among the\\npromontories of the lonely hills, they came upon the schoolhouse, roofed\\nand ready for the first native Wyoming crop. It symbolized the dawn of a\\nneighborhood, and it brought a change into the wilderness air. The feel\\nof it struck cold upon the free spirits of the cow-punchers, and they\\ntold each other that, what with women and children and wire fences, this\\ncountry would not long be a country for men. They stopped for a meal at\\nan old comrade's. They looked over his gate, and there he was pattering\\namong garden furrows.\\n\\n“Pickin' nosegays?” inquired the Virginian and the old comrade asked\\nif they could not recognize potatoes except in the dish. But he grinned\\nsheepishly at them, too, because they knew that he had not always lived\\nin a garden. Then he took them into his house, where they saw an object\\ncrawling on the floor with a handful of sulphur matches. He began to\\nremove the matches, but stopped in alarm at the vociferous result; and\\nhis wife looked in from the kitchen to caution him about humoring little\\nChristopher.\\n\\nWhen she beheld the matches she was aghast but when she saw her baby\\ngrow quiet in the arms of the Virginian, she smiled at that cow-puncher\\nand returned to her kitchen.\\n\\nThen the Virginian slowly spoke again: “How many little strangers have\\nyu' got, James?”\\n\\n“Only two.”\\n\\n“My! Ain't it most three years since yu' maried? Yu' mustn't let time\\ncreep ahaid o' yu', James.”\\n\\nThe father once more grinned at his guests, who themselves turned\\nsheepish and polite; for Mrs. Westfall came in, brisk and hearty, and\\nset the meat upon the table. After that, it was she who talked. The\\nguests ate scrupulously, muttering, “Yes, ma'am,” and “No, ma'am,” in\\ntheir plates, while their hostess told them of increasing families upon\\nBear Creek, and the expected school-teacher, and little Alfred's early\\nteething, and how it was time for all of them to become husbands like\\nJames. The bachelors of the saddle listened, always diffident,\\nbut eating heartily to the end; and soon after they rode away in a\\nthoughtful clump. The wives of Bear Creek were few as yet, and the homes\\nscattered; the schoolhouse was only a sprig on the vast face of a world\\nof elk and bear and uncertain Indians; but that night, when the earth\\nnear the fire was littered with the cow-punchers' beds, the Virginian\\nwas heard drawling to himself: “Alfred and Christopher. Oh, sugar!”\\n\\nThey found pleasure in the delicately chosen shade of this oath. He also\\nrecited to them a new verse about how he took his Looloo girl to the\\nschoolhouse for to learn her A B C; and as it was quite original and\\nunprintable, the camp laughed and swore joyfully, and rolled in its\\nblankets to sleep under the stars.\\n\\nUpon a Monday noon likewise (for things will happen so) some tearful\\npeople in petticoats waved handkerchiefs at a train that was just\\nleaving Bennington, Vermont. A girl's face smiled back at them once, and\\nwithdrew quickly, for they must not see the smile die away.\\n\\nShe had with her a little money, a few clothes, and in her mind a rigid\\ndetermination neither to be a burden to her mother nor to give in to\\nthat mother's desires. Absence alone would enable her to carry out\\nthis determination. Beyond these things, she possessed not much except\\nspelling-books, a colonial miniature, and that craving for the unknown\\nwhich has been mentioned. If the ancestors that we carry shut up inside\\nus take turns in dictating to us our actions and our state of mind,\\nundoubtedly Grandmother Stark was empress of Molly's spirit upon this\\nMonday.\\n\\nAt Hoosic Junction, which came soon, she passed the up-train bound back\\nto her home, and seeing the engineer and the conductor,--faces that she\\nknew well,--her courage nearly failed her, and she shut her eyes against\\nthis glimpse of the familiar things that she was leaving. To keep\\nherself steady she gripped tightly a little bunch of flowers in her\\nhand.\\n\\nBut something caused her eyes to open; and there before her stood Sam\\nBannett, asking if he might accompany her so far as Rotterdam Junction.\\n\\n“No!” she told him with a severity born from the struggle she was making\\nwith her grief. “Not a mile with me. Not to Eagle Bridge. Good-by.”\\n\\nAnd Sam--what did he do? He obeyed her, I should like to be sorry for\\nhim. But obedience was not a lover's part here. He hesitated, the golden\\nmoment hung hovering, the conductor cried “All aboard!” the train went,\\nand there on the platform stood obedient Sam, with his golden moment\\ngone like a butterfly.\\n\\nAfter Rotterdam Junction, which was some forty minutes farther, Molly\\nWood sat bravely up in the through car, dwelling upon the unknown. She\\nthought that she had attained it in Ohio, on Tuesday morning, and wrote\\na letter about it to Bennington. On Wednesday afternoon she felt sure,\\nand wrote a letter much more picturesque. But on the following day,\\nafter breakfast at North Platte, Nebraska, she wrote a very long letter\\nindeed, and told them that she had seen a black pig on a white pile of\\nbuffalo bones, catching drops of water in the air as they fell from the\\nrailroad tank. She also wrote that trees were extraordinarily scarce.\\nEach hour westward from the pig confirmed this opinion, and when she\\nleft the train at Rock Creek, late upon that fourth night,--in those\\ndays the trains were slower,--she knew that she had really attained the\\nunknown, and sent an expensive telegram to say that she was quite well.\\n\\nAt six in the morning the stage drove away into the sage-brush, with her\\nas its only passenger; and by sundown she had passed through some of the\\nprimitive perils of the world. The second team, virgin to harness, and\\ndispleased with this novelty, tried to take it off, and went down to the\\nbottom of a gully on its eight hind legs, while Miss Wood sat mute and\\nunflinching beside the driver. Therefore he, when it was over, and they\\non the proper road again, invited her earnestly to be his wife during\\nmany of the next fifteen miles, and told her of his snug cabin and his\\nhorses and his mine. Then she got down and rode inside, Independence and\\nGrandmother Stark shining in her eye. At Point of Rocks, where they had\\nsupper and his drive ended, her face distracted his heart, and he told\\nher once more about his cabin, and lamentably hoped she would remember\\nhim. She answered sweetly that she would try, and gave him her hand.\\nAfter all, he was a frank-looking boy, who had paid her the highest\\ncompliment that a boy (or a man for that matter) knows; and it is said\\nthat Molly Stark, in her day, was not a New Woman.\\n\\nThe new driver banished the first one from the maiden's mind. He was not\\na frank-looking boy, and he had been taking whiskey. All night long he\\ntook it, while his passenger, helpless and sleepless inside the lurching\\nstage, sat as upright as she possibly could; nor did the voices that she\\nheard at Drybone reassure her. Sunrise found the white stage lurching\\neternally on across the alkali, with a driver and a bottle on the\\nbox, and a pale girl staring out at the plain, and knotting in her\\nhandkerchief some utterly dead flowers. They came to a river where the\\nman bungled over the ford. Two wheels sank down over an edge, and the\\ncanvas toppled like a descending kite. The ripple came sucking through\\nthe upper spokes, and as she felt the seat careen, she put out her\\nhead and tremulously asked if anything was wrong. But the driver was\\naddressing his team with much language, and also with the lash.\\n\\nThen a tall rider appeared close against the buried axles, and took her\\nout of the stage on his horse so suddenly that she screamed. She felt\\nsplashes, saw a swimming flood, and found herself lifted down upon the\\nshore. The rider said something to her about cheering up, and its being\\nall right, but her wits were stock-still, so she did not speak and thank\\nhim. After four days of train and thirty hours of stage, she was having\\na little too much of the unknown at once. Then the tall man gently\\nwithdrew leaving her to become herself again. She limply regarded the\\nriver pouring round the slanted stage, and a number of horsemen with\\nropes, who righted the vehicle, and got it quickly to dry land, and\\ndisappeared at once with a herd of cattle, uttering lusty yells.\\n\\nShe saw the tall one delaying beside the driver, and speaking. He spoke\\nso quietly that not a word reached her, until of a sudden the driver\\nprotested loudly. The man had thrown something, which turned out to be\\na bottle. This twisted loftily and dived into the stream. He said\\nsomething more to the driver, then put his hand on the saddle-horn,\\nlooked half-lingeringly at the passenger on the bank, dropped his\\ngrave eyes from hers, and swinging upon his horse, was gone just as the\\npassenger opened her mouth and with inefficient voice murmured, “Oh,\\nthank you!” at his departing back.\\n\\nThe driver drove up now, a chastened creature. He helped Miss Wood in,\\nand inquired after her welfare with a hanging head; then meek as his own\\ndrenched horses, he climbed back to his reins, and nursed the stage on\\ntoward the Bow Leg Mountains much as if it had been a perambulator.\\n\\nAs for Miss Wood, she sat recovering, and she wondered what the man on\\nthe horse must think of her. She knew that she was not ungrateful, and\\nthat if he had given her an opportunity she would have explained to him.\\nIf he supposed that she did not appreciate his act--Here into the midst\\nof these meditations came an abrupt memory that she had screamed--she\\ncould not be sure when. She rehearsed the adventure from the beginning,\\nand found one or two further uncertainties--how it had all been while\\nshe was on the horse, for instance. It was confusing to determine\\nprecisely what she had done with her arms. She knew where one of his\\narms had been. And the handkerchief with the flowers was gone. She made\\na few rapid dives in search of it. Had she, or had she not, seen him\\nputting something in his pocket? And why had she behaved so unlike\\nherself? In a few miles Miss Wood entertained sentiments of maidenly\\nresentment toward her rescuer, and of maidenly hope to see him again.\\n\\nTo that river crossing he came again, alone, when the days were growing\\nshort. The ford was dry sand, and the stream a winding lane of\\nshingle. He found a pool,--pools always survive the year round in this\\nstream,--and having watered his pony, he lunched near the spot to\\nwhich he had borne the frightened passenger that day. Where the flowing\\ncurrent had been he sat, regarding the now extremely safe channel.\\n\\n“She cert'nly wouldn't need to grip me so close this mawnin',” he said,\\nas he pondered over his meal. “I reckon it will mightily astonish her\\nwhen I tell her how harmless the torrent is lookin'.” He held out to\\nhis pony a slice of bread matted with sardines, which the pony expertly\\naccepted. “You're a plumb pie-biter you Monte,” he continued. Monte\\nrubbed his nose on his master's shoulder. “I wouldn't trust you with\\nberries and cream. No, seh; not though yu' did rescue a drownin' lady.”\\n\\nPresently he tightened the forward cinch, got in the saddle, and the\\npony fell into his wise mechanical jog; for he had come a long way, and\\nwas going a long way, and he knew this as well as the man did.\\n\\nTo use the language of Cattle Land, steers had “jumped to seventy-five.”\\n This was a great and prosperous leap in their value. To have flourished\\nin that golden time you need not be dead now, nor even middle-aged; but\\nit is Wyoming mythology already--quite as fabulous as the high-jumping\\ncow. Indeed, people gathered together and behaved themselves much in\\nthe same pleasant and improbable way. Johnson County, and Natrona, and\\nConverse, and others, to say nothing of the Cheyenne Club, had been\\njumping over the moon for some weeks, all on account of steers; and\\non the strength of this vigorous price of seventy-five, the Stanton\\nBrothers were giving a barbecue at the Goose Egg outfit, their ranch on\\nBear Creek. Of course the whole neighborhood was bidden, and would come\\nforty miles to a man; some would come further--the Virginian was coming\\na hundred and eighteen. It had struck him--rather suddenly, as shall be\\nmade plain--that he should like to see how they were getting along up\\nthere on Bear Creek. “They,” was how he put it to his acquaintances. His\\nacquaintances did not know that he had bought himself a pair of trousers\\nand a scarf, unnecessarily excellent for such a general visit. They\\ndid not know that in the spring, two days after the adventure with the\\nstage, he had learned accidentally who the lady in the stage was. This\\nhe had kept to himself; nor did the camp ever notice that he had ceased\\nto sing that eightieth stanza he had made about the A B C--the stanza\\nwhich was not printable. He effaced it imperceptibly, giving the boys\\nthe other seventy-nine at judicious intervals. They dreamed of no guile,\\nbut merely saw in him, whether frequenting camp or town, the same not\\nover-angelic comrade whom they valued and could not wholly understand.\\n\\nAll spring he had ridden trail, worked at ditches during summer, and\\nnow he had just finished with the beef round-up. Yesterday, while he was\\nspending a little comfortable money at the Drybone hog-ranch, a casual\\ntraveller from the north gossiped of Bear Creek, and the fences up\\nthere, and the farm crops, the Westfalls, and the young schoolmarm from\\nVermont, for whom the Taylors had built a cabin next door to theirs. The\\ntraveller had not seen her, but Mrs. Taylor and all the ladies thought\\nthe world of her, and Lin McLean had told him she was “away up in G.”\\n She would have plenty of partners at this Swinton barbecue. Great boon\\nfor the country, wasn't it, steers jumping that way?\\n\\nThe Virginian heard, asking no questions; and left town in an hour,\\nwith the scarf and trousers tied in his slicker behind his saddle. After\\nlooking upon the ford again, even though it was dry and not at all the\\nsame place, he journeyed in attentively. When you have been hard at\\nwork for months with no time to think, of course you think a great deal\\nduring your first empty days. “Step along, you Monte hawss!” he said,\\nrousing after some while. He disciplined Monte, who flattened his ears\\naffectedly and snorted. “Why, you surely ain' thinkin' of you'-self as\\na hero? She wasn't really a-drowndin', you pie-biter.” He rested his\\nserious glance upon the alkali. “She's not likely to have forgot that\\nmix-up, though. I guess I'll not remind her about grippin' me, and all\\nthat. She wasn't the kind a man ought to josh about such things. She had\\na right clear eye.” Thus, tall and loose in the saddle, did he jog along\\nthe sixty miles which still lay between him and the dance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX. WHERE FANCY WAS BRED\\n\\n\\nTwo camps in the open, and the Virginian's Monte horse, untired, brought\\nhim to the Swintons' in good time for the barbecue. The horse received\\ngood food at length, while his rider was welcomed with good whiskey.\\nGOOD whiskey--for had not steers jumped to seventy-five?\\n\\nInside the Goose Egg kitchen many small delicacies were preparing, and\\na steer was roasting whole outside. The bed of flame under it showed\\nsteadily brighter against the dusk that was beginning to veil the\\nlowlands. The busy hosts went and came, while men stood and men lay near\\nthe fire-glow. Chalkeye was there, and Nebrasky, and Trampas, and\\nHoney Wiggin, with others, enjoying the occasion; but Honey Wiggin was\\nenjoying himself: he had an audience; he was sitting up discoursing to\\nit.\\n\\n“Hello!” he said, perceiving the Virginian. “So you've dropped in for\\nyour turn! Number--six, ain't he, boys?”\\n\\n“Depends who's a-runnin' the countin',” said the Virginian, and\\nstretched himself down among the audience.\\n\\n“I've saw him number one when nobody else was around,” said Trampas.\\n\\n“How far away was you standin' when you beheld that?” inquired the\\nlounging Southerner.\\n\\n“Well, boys,” said Wiggin, “I expect it will be Miss Schoolmarm says\\nwho's number one to-night.”\\n\\n“So she's arrived in this hyeh country?” observed the Virginian, very\\ncasually.\\n\\n“Arrived!” said Trampas again. “Where have you been grazing lately?”\\n\\n“A right smart way from the mules.”\\n\\n“Nebrasky and the boys was tellin' me they'd missed yu' off the range,”\\n again interposed Wiggin. “Say, Nebrasky, who have yu' offered your\\ncanary to the schoolmarm said you mustn't give her?”\\n\\nNebrasky grinned wretchedly.\\n\\n“Well, she's a lady, and she's square, not takin' a man's gift when she\\ndon't take the man. But you'd ought to get back all them letters yu'\\nwrote her. Yu' sure ought to ask her for them tell-tales.”\\n\\n“Ah, pshaw, Honey!” protested the youth. It was well known that he could\\nnot write his name.\\n\\n“Why, if here ain't Bokay Baldy!” cried the agile Wiggin, stooping to\\nfresh prey. “Found them slippers yet, Baldy? Tell yu' boys, that was\\nturruble sad luck Baldy had. Did yu' hear about that? Baldy, yu' know,\\nhe can stay on a tame horse most as well as the schoolmarm. But just you\\ngive him a pair of young knittin'-needles and see him make 'em sweat!\\nHe worked an elegant pair of slippers with pink cabbages on 'em for Miss\\nWood.”\\n\\n“I bought 'em at Medicine Bow,” blundered Baldy.\\n\\n“So yu' did!” assented the skilful comedian. “Baldy he bought 'em. And\\non the road to her cabin there at the Taylors' he got thinkin' they\\nmight be too big, and he got studyin' what to do. And he fixed up to\\ntell her about his not bein' sure of the size, and how she was to let\\nhim know if they dropped off her, and he'd exchange 'em, and when he\\ngot right near her door, why, he couldn't find his courage. And so he\\nslips the parcel under the fence and starts serenadin' her. But she\\nain't inside her cabin at all. She's at supper next door with the\\nTaylors, and Baldy singin' 'Love has conqwered pride and angwer' to a\\nlone house. Lin McLean was comin' up by Taylor's corral, where Taylor's\\nTexas bull was. Well, it was turruble sad. Baldy's pants got tore, but\\nhe fell inside the fence, and Lin druv the bull back and somebody stole\\nthem Medicine Bow galoshes. Are you goin' to knit her some more, Bokay?”\\n\\n“About half that ain't straight,” Baldy commented, with mildness.\\n\\n“The half that was tore off yer pants? Well, never mind, Baldy; Lin will\\nget left too, same as all of yu'.”\\n\\n“Is there many?” inquired the Virginian. He was still stretched on his\\nback, looking up at the sky.\\n\\n“I don't know how many she's been used to where she was raised,” Wiggin\\nanswered. “A kid stage-driver come from Point of Rocks one day and went\\nback the next. Then the foreman of the 76 outfit, and the horse-wrangler\\nfrom the Bar-Circle-L, and two deputy marshals, with punchers, stringin'\\nright along,--all got their tumble. Old Judge Burrage from Cheyenne come\\nup in August for a hunt and stayed round here and never hunted at all.\\nThere was that horse thief--awful good-lookin'. Taylor wanted to warn\\nher about him, but Mrs. Taylor said she'd look after her if it was\\nneeded. Mr. Horse-thief gave it up quicker than most; but the schoolmarm\\ncouldn't have knowed he had a Mrs. Horse-thief camped on Poison Spider\\ntill afterwards. She wouldn't go ridin' with him. She'll go with some,\\ntakin' a kid along.”\\n\\n“Bah!” said Trampas.\\n\\nThe Virginian stopped looking at the sky, and watched Trampas from where\\nhe lay.\\n\\n“I think she encourages a man some,” said poor Nebrasky.\\n\\n“Encourages? Because she lets yu' teach her how to shoot,” said Wiggin.\\n“Well--I don't guess I'm a judge. I've always kind o' kep' away from\\nthem good women. Don't seem to think of anything to chat about to 'em.\\nThe only folks I'd say she encourages is the school kids. She kisses\\nthem.”\\n\\n“Riding and shooting and kissing the kids,” sneered Trampas. “That's a\\nheap too pussy-kitten for me.”\\n\\nThey laughed. The sage-brush audience is readily cynical.\\n\\n“Look for the man, I say,” Trampas pursued. “And ain't he there? She\\nleaves Baldy sit on the fence while she and Lin McLean--”\\n\\nThey laughed loudly at the blackguard picture which he drew; and the\\nlaugh stopped short, for the Virginian stood over Trampas.\\n\\n“You can rise up now, and tell them you lie,” he said.\\n\\nThe man was still for a moment in the dead silence. “I thought you\\nclaimed you and her wasn't acquainted,” said he then.\\n\\n“Stand on your laigs, you polecat, and say you're a liar!”\\n\\nTrampas's hand moved behind him.\\n\\n“Quit that,” said the Southerner, “or I'll break your neck!”\\n\\nThe eye of a man is the prince of deadly weapons. Trampas looked in the\\nVirginian's, and slowly rose. “I didn't mean--” he began, and paused,\\nhis face poisonously bloated.\\n\\n“Well, I'll call that sufficient. Keep a-standin' still. I ain' going\\nto trouble yu' long. In admittin' yourself to be a liar you have spoke\\nGod's truth for onced. Honey Wiggin, you and me and the boys have hit\\ntown too frequent for any of us to play Sunday on the balance of\\nthe gang.” He stopped and surveyed Public Opinion, seated around in\\ncarefully inexpressive attention. “We ain't a Christian outfit a little\\nbit, and maybe we have most forgotten what decency feels like. But I\\nreckon we haven't forgot what it means. You can sit down now, if you\\nwant.”\\n\\nThe liar stood and sneered experimentally, looking at Public Opinion.\\nBut this changeful deity was no longer with him, and he heard it\\nvariously assenting, “That's so,” and “She's a lady,” and otherwise\\nexcellently moralizing. So he held his peace. When, however, the\\nVirginian had departed to the roasting steer, and Public Opinion relaxed\\ninto that comfort which we all experience when the sermon ends, Trampas\\nsat down amid the reviving cheerfulness, and ventured again to be\\nfacetious.\\n\\n“Shut your rank mouth,” said Wiggin to him, amiably. “I don't care\\nwhether he knows her or if he done it on principle. I'll accept the\\nroundin' up he gave us--and say! You'll swallo' your dose, too! Us\\nboys'll stand in with him in this.”\\n\\nSo Trampas swallowed. And what of the Virginian?\\n\\nHe had championed the feeble, and spoken honorably in meeting, and\\naccording to all the constitutions and by-laws of morality, he should\\nhave been walking in virtue's especial calm. But there it was! he had\\nspoken; he had given them a peep through the key-hole at his inner\\nman; and as he prowled away from the assemblage before whom he stood\\nconvicted of decency, it was vicious rather than virtuous that he felt.\\nOther matters also disquieted him--so Lin McLean was hanging round that\\nschoolmarm! Yet he joined Ben Swinton in a seemingly Christian spirit.\\nHe took some whiskey and praised the size of the barrel, speaking with\\nhis host like this: “There cert'nly ain' goin' to be trouble about a\\nsecond helpin'.”\\n\\n“Hope not. We'd ought to have more trimmings, though. We're shy on\\nducks.”\\n\\n“Yu' have the barrel. Has Lin McLean seen that?”\\n\\n“No. We tried for ducks away down as far as the Laparel outfit. A real\\nbarbecue--”\\n\\n“There's large thirsts on Bear Creek. Lin McLean will pass on ducks.”\\n\\n“Lin's not thirsty this month.”\\n\\n“Signed for one month, has he?”\\n\\n“Signed! He's spooning our schoolmarm!”\\n\\n“They claim she's a right sweet-faced girl.”\\n\\n“Yes; yes; awful agreeable. And next thing you're fooled clean through.”\\n\\n“Yu' don't say!”\\n\\n“She keeps a-teaching the darned kids, and it seems like a good\\ngrowed-up man can't interest her.”\\n\\n“YU' DON'T SAY!”\\n\\n“There used to be all the ducks you wanted at the Laparel, but their\\nfool cook's dead stuck on raising turkeys this year.”\\n\\n“That must have been mighty close to a drowndin' the schoolmarm got at\\nSouth Fork.”\\n\\n“Why, I guess not. When? She's never spoken of any such thing--that I've\\nheard.”\\n\\n“Mos' likely the stage-driver got it wrong, then.”\\n\\n“Yes. Must have drownded somebody else. Here they come! That's her\\nridin' the horse. There's the Westfalls. Where are you running to?”\\n\\n“To fix up. Got any soap around hyeh?”\\n\\n“Yes,” shouted Swinton, for the Virginian was now some distance away;\\n“towels and everything in the dugout.” And he went to welcome his first\\nformal guests.\\n\\nThe Virginian reached his saddle under a shed. “So she's never mentioned\\nit,” said he, untying his slicker for the trousers and scarf. “I\\ndidn't notice Lin anywheres around her.” He was over in the dugout now,\\nwhipping off his overalls; and soon he was excellently clean and ready,\\nexcept for the tie in his scarf and the part in his hair. “I'd have\\nknowed her in Greenland,” he remarked. He held the candle up and down at\\nthe looking-glass, and the looking-glass up and down at his head. “It's\\nmighty strange why she ain't mentioned that.” He worried the scarf a\\nfold or two further, and at length, a trifle more than satisfied with\\nhis appearance, he proceeded most serenely toward the sound of the\\ntuning fiddles. He passed through the store-room behind the kitchen,\\nstepping lightly lest he should rouse the ten or twelve babies that lay\\non the table or beneath it. On Bear Creek babies and children always\\nwent with their parents to a dance, because nurses were unknown. So\\nlittle Alfred and Christopher lay there among the wraps, parallel and\\ncrosswise with little Taylors, and little Carmodys, and Lees, and all\\nthe Bear Creek offspring that was not yet able to skip at large and\\nhamper its indulgent elders in the ball-room.\\n\\n“Why, Lin ain't hyeh yet!” said the Virginian, looking in upon the\\npeople. There was Miss Wood, standing up for the quadrille. “I didn't\\nremember her hair was that pretty,” said he. “But ain't she a little,\\nlittle girl!”\\n\\nNow she was in truth five feet three; but then he could look away down\\non the top of her head.\\n\\n“Salute your honey!” called the first fiddler. All partners bowed to\\neach other, and as she turned, Miss Wood saw the man in the doorway.\\nAgain, as it had been at South Fork that day, his eyes dropped from\\nhers, and she divining instantly why he had come after half a year,\\nthought of the handkerchief and of that scream of hers in the river, and\\nbecame filled with tyranny and anticipation; for indeed he was fine to\\nlook upon. So she danced away, carefully unaware of his existence.\\n\\n“First lady, centre!” said her partner, reminding her of her turn. “Have\\nyou forgotten how it goes since last time?”\\n\\nMolly Wood did not forget again, but quadrilled with the most sprightly\\ndevotion.\\n\\n“I see some new faces to-night,” said she, presently.\\n\\n“Yu' always do forget our poor faces,” said her partner.\\n\\n“Oh, no! There's a stranger now. Who is that black man?”\\n\\n“Well--he's from Virginia, and he ain't allowin' he's black.”\\n\\n“He's a tenderfoot, I suppose?”\\n\\n“Ha, ha, ha! That's rich, too!” and so the simple partner explained a\\ngreat deal about the Virginian to Molly Wood. At the end of the set she\\nsaw the man by the door take a step in her direction.\\n\\n“Oh,” said she, quickly, to the partner, “how warm it is! I must see\\nhow those babies are doing.” And she passed the Virginian in a breeze of\\nunconcern.\\n\\nHis eyes gravely lingered where she had gone. “She knowed me right\\naway,” said he. He looked for a moment, then leaned against the door.\\n“'How warm it is!' said she. Well, it ain't so screechin' hot hyeh; and\\nas for rushin' after Alfred and Christopher, when their natural motheh\\nis bumpin' around handy--she cert'nly can't be offended?” he broke\\noff, and looked again where she had gone. And then Miss Wood passed him\\nbrightly again, and was dancing the schottische almost immediately.\\n“Oh, yes, she knows me,” the swarthy cow-puncher mused. “She has to\\ntake trouble not to see me. And what she's a-fussin' at is mighty\\ninterestin'. Hello!”\\n\\n“Hello!” returned Lin McLean, sourly. He had just looked into the\\nkitchen.\\n\\n“Not dancin'?” the Southerner inquired.\\n\\n“Don't know how.”\\n\\n“Had scyarlet fever and forgot your past life?”\\n\\nLin grinned.\\n\\n“Better persuade the schoolmarm to learn it. She's goin' to give me\\ninstruction.”\\n\\n“Huh!” went Mr. McLean, and skulked out to the barrel.\\n\\n“Why, they claimed you weren't drinkin' this month!” said his friend,\\nfollowing.\\n\\n“Well, I am. Here's luck!” The two pledged in tin cups. “But I'm not\\nwaltzin' with her,” blurted Mr. McLean grievously. “She called me an\\nexception.”\\n\\n“Waltzin',” repeated the Virginian quickly, and hearing the fiddles he\\nhastened away.\\n\\nFew in the Bear Creek Country could waltz, and with these few it\\nwas mostly an unsteered and ponderous exhibition; therefore was the\\nSoutherner bent upon profiting by his skill. He entered the room,\\nand his lady saw him come where she sat alone for the moment, and her\\nthoughts grew a little hurried.\\n\\n“Will you try a turn, ma'am?”\\n\\n“I beg your pardon?” It was a remote, well-schooled eye that she lifted\\nnow upon him.\\n\\n“If you like a waltz, ma'am, will you waltz with me?”\\n\\n“You're from Virginia, I understand?” said Molly Wood, regarding him\\npolitely, but not rising. One gains authority immensely by keeping one's\\nseat. All good teachers know this.\\n\\n“Yes, ma'am, from Virginia.”\\n\\n“I've heard that Southerners have such good manners.”\\n\\n“That's correct.” The cow-puncher flushed, but he spoke in his\\nunvaryingly gentle voice.\\n\\n“For in New England, you know,” pursued Miss Molly, noting his scarf and\\nclean-shaven chin, and then again steadily meeting his eye, “gentlemen\\nask to be presented to ladies before they ask them to waltz.”\\n\\nHe stood a moment before her, deeper and deeper scarlet; and the more\\nshe saw his handsome face, the keener rose her excitement. She waited\\nfor him to speak of the river; for then she was going to be surprised,\\nand gradually to remember, and finally to be very nice to him. But he\\ndid not wait. “I ask your pardon, lady,” said he, and bowing, walked\\noff, leaving her at once afraid that he might not come back. But she had\\naltogether mistaken her man. Back he came serenely with Mr. Taylor, and\\nwas duly presented to her. Thus were the conventions vindicated.\\n\\nIt can never be known what the cow-puncher was going to say next; for\\nUncle Hughey stepped up with a glass of water which he had left Wood to\\nbring, and asking for a turn, most graciously received it. She danced\\naway from a situation where she began to feel herself getting the\\nworst of it. One moment the Virginian stared at his lady as she lightly\\ncirculated, and then he went out to the barrel.\\n\\nLeave him for Uncle Hershey! Jealousy is a deep and delicate thing, and\\nworks its spite in many ways. The Virginian had been ready to look at\\nLin McLean with a hostile eye; but finding him now beside the barrel, he\\nfelt a brotherhood between himself and Lin, and his hostility had taken\\na new and whimsical direction.\\n\\n“Here's how!” said he to McLean. And they pledged each other in the tin\\ncups.\\n\\n“Been gettin' them instructions?” said Mr. McLean, grinning. “I thought\\nI saw yu' learning your steps through the window.”\\n\\n“Here's your good health,” said the Southerner. Once more they pledged\\neach other handsomely.\\n\\n“Did she call you an exception, or anything?” said Lin.\\n\\n“Well, it would cipher out right close in that neighborhood.”\\n\\n“Here's how, then!” cried the delighted Lin, over his cup.\\n\\n“Jest because yu' happen to come from Vermont,” continued Mr. McLean,\\n“is no cause for extra pride. Shoo! I was raised in Massachusetts\\nmyself, and big men have been raised there, too,--Daniel Webster and\\nIsrael Putnam: and a lot of them politicians.”\\n\\n“Virginia is a good little old state,” observed the Southerner.\\n\\n“Both of 'em's a sight ahead of Vermont. She told me I was the first\\nexception she'd struck.”\\n\\n“What rule were you provin' at the time, Lin?”\\n\\n“Well yu' see, I started to kiss her.”\\n\\n“Yu' didn't!”\\n\\n“Shucks! I didn't mean nothin'.”\\n\\n“I reckon yu' stopped mighty sudden?”\\n\\n“Why, I'd been ridin' out with her--ridin' to school, ridin' from\\nschool, and a-comin' and a-goin', and she chattin' cheerful and askin'\\nme a heap o' questions all about myself every day, and I not lyin' much\\nneither. And so I figured she wouldn't mind. Lots of 'em like it. But\\nshe didn't, you bet!”\\n\\n“No,” said the Virginian, deeply proud of his lady who had slighted him.\\nHe had pulled her out of the water once, and he had been her unrewarded\\nknight even to-day, and he felt his grievance; but he spoke not of it\\nto Lin; for he felt also, in memory, her arms clinging round him as he\\ncarried her ashore upon his horse. But he muttered, “Plumb ridiculous!”\\n as her injustice struck him afresh, while the outraged McLean told his\\ntale.\\n\\n“Trample is what she has done on me to-night, and without notice. We was\\nstartin' to come here; Taylor and Mrs. were ahead in the buggy, and I\\nwas holdin' her horse, and helpin' her up in the saddle, like I done for\\ndays and days. Who was there to see us? And I figured she'd not mind,\\nand she calls me an exception! Yu'd ought to've just heard her about\\nWestern men respectin' women. So that's the last word we've spoke.\\nWe come twenty-five miles then, she scootin' in front, and her horse\\nkickin' the sand in my face. Mrs. Taylor, she guessed something was up,\\nbut she didn't tell.”\\n\\n“Miss Wood did not tell?”\\n\\n“Not she! She'll never open her head. She can take care of herself, you\\nbet!” The fiddles sounded hilariously in the house, and the feet also.\\nThey had warmed up altogether, and their dancing figures crossed the\\nwindows back and forth. The two cow-punchers drew near to a window and\\nlooked in gloomily.\\n\\n“There she goes,” said Lin.\\n\\n“With Uncle Hughey again,” said the Virginian, sourly. “Yu' might\\nsuppose he didn't have a wife and twins, to see the way he goes\\ngambollin' around.”\\n\\n“Westfall is takin' a turn with her now,” said McLean.\\n\\n“James!” exclaimed the Virginian. “He's another with a wife and fam'ly,\\nand he gets the dancin', too.”\\n\\n“There she goes with Taylor,” said Lin, presently.\\n\\n“Another married man!” the Southerner commented. They prowled round to\\nthe store-room, and passed through the kitchen to where the dancers were\\nrobustly tramping. Miss Wood was still the partner of Mr. Taylor. “Let's\\nhave some whiskey,” said the Virginian. They had it, and returned, and\\nthe Virginian's disgust and sense of injury grew deeper. “Old Carmody\\nhas got her now,” he drawled. “He polkas like a landslide. She learns\\nhis monkey-faced kid to spell dog and cow all the mawnin'. He'd ought to\\nbe tucked up cosey in his bed right now, old Carmody ought.”\\n\\nThey were standing in that place set apart for the sleeping children;\\nand just at this moment one of two babies that were stowed beneath\\na chair uttered a drowsy note. A much louder cry, indeed a chorus of\\nlament, would have been needed to reach the ears of the parents in the\\nroom beyond, such was the noisy volume of the dance. But in this quiet\\nplace the light sound caught Mr. McLean's attention, and he turned to\\nsee if anything were wrong. But both babies were sleeping peacefully.\\n\\n“Them's Uncle Hughey's twins,” he said.\\n\\n“How do you happen to know that?” inquired the Virginian, suddenly\\ninterested.\\n\\n“Saw his wife put 'em under the chair so she could find 'em right off\\nwhen she come to go home.”\\n\\n“Oh,” said the Virginian, thoughtfully. “Oh, find 'em right off. Yes.\\nUncle Hughey's twins.” He walked to a spot from which he could view the\\ndance. “Well,” he continued, returning, “the schoolmarm must have taken\\nquite a notion to Uncle Hughey. He has got her for this quadrille.” The\\nVirginian was now speaking without rancor; but his words came with a\\nslightly augmented drawl, and this with him was often a bad omen. He\\nnow turned his eyes upon the collected babies wrapped in various\\ncolored shawls and knitted work. “Nine, ten, eleven, beautiful sleepin'\\nstrangers,” he counted, in a sweet voice. “Any of 'em your'n, Lin?”\\n\\n“Not that I know of,” grinned Mr. McLean.\\n\\n“Eleven, twelve. This hyeh is little Christopher in the blue-stripe\\nquilt--or maybe that other yello'-head is him. The angels have commenced\\nto drop in on us right smart along Bear Creek, Lin.”\\n\\n“What trash are yu' talkin' anyway?”\\n\\n“If they look so awful alike in the heavenly gyarden,” the gentle\\nSoutherner continued, “I'd just hate to be the folks that has the\\ncuttin' of 'em out o' the general herd. And that's a right quaint notion\\ntoo,” he added softly. “Them under the chair are Uncle Hughey's, didn't\\nyou tell me?” And stooping, he lifted the torpid babies and placed them\\nbeneath a table. “No, that ain't thorough,” he murmured. With wonderful\\ndexterity and solicitude for their wellfare, he removed the loose wrap\\nwhich was around them, and this soon led to an intricate process of\\nexchange. For a moment Mr. McLean had been staring at the Virginian,\\npuzzled. Then, with a joyful yelp of enlightenment, he sprang to abet\\nhim.\\n\\nAnd while both busied themselves with the shawls and quilts, the\\nunconscious parents went dancing vigorously on, and the small,\\noccasional cries of their progeny did not reach them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXI. “YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE ME BEFORE WE GET THROUGH”\\n\\n\\nThe Swinton barbecue was over. The fiddles were silent, the steer was\\neaten, the barrel emptied, or largely so, and the tapers extinguished;\\nround the house and sunken fire all movement of guests was quiet;\\nthe families were long departed homeward, and after their hospitable\\nturbulence, the Swintons slept.\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. Westfall drove through the night, and as they neared their\\ncabin there came from among the bundled wraps a still, small voice.\\n\\n“Jim,” said his wife, “I said Alfred would catch cold.”\\n\\n“Bosh! Lizzie, don't you fret. He's a little more than a yearlin', and\\nof course he'll snuffle.” And young James took a kiss from his love.\\n\\n“Well, how you can speak of Alfred that way, calling him a yearling, as\\nif he was a calf, and he just as much your child as mine, I don't see,\\nJames Westfall!”\\n\\n“Why, what under the sun do you mean?”\\n\\n“There he goes again! Do hurry up home, Jim. He's got a real strange\\ncough.”\\n\\nSo they hurried home. Soon the nine miles were finished, and good\\nJames was unhitching by his stable lantern, while his wife in the house\\nhastened to commit their offspring to bed. The traces had dropped, and\\neach horse marched forward for further unbuckling, when James heard\\nhimself called. Indeed, there was that in his wife's voice which made\\nhim jerk out his pistol as he ran. But it was no bear or Indian--only\\ntwo strange children on the bed. His wife was glaring at them.\\n\\nHe sighed with relief and laid down the pistol.\\n\\n“Put that on again, James Westfall. You'll need it. Look here!”\\n\\n“Well, they won't bite. Whose are they? Where have you stowed ourn?”\\n\\n“Where have I--” Utterance forsook this mother for a moment. “And you\\nask me!” she continued. “Ask Lin McLean. Ask him that sets bulls on\\nfolks and steals slippers, what he's done with our innocent lambs,\\nmixing them up with other people's coughing, unhealthy brats. That's\\nCharlie Taylor in Alfred's clothes, and I know Alfred didn't cough like\\nthat, and I said to you it was strange; and the other one that's been\\nput in Christopher's new quilts is not even a bub--bub--boy!”\\n\\nAs this crime against society loomed clear to James Westfall's\\nunderstanding, he sat down on the nearest piece of furniture, and\\nheedless of his wife's tears and his exchanged children, broke into\\nunregenerate laughter. Doubtless after his sharp alarm about the bear,\\nhe was unstrung. His lady, however, promptly restrung him; and by the\\ntime they had repacked the now clamorous changelings, and were rattling\\non their way to the Taylors', he began to share her outraged feelings\\nproperly, as a husband and a father should; but when he reached the\\nTaylors' and learned from Miss Wood that at this house a child had\\nbeen unwrapped whom nobody could at all identify, and that Mr. and Mrs.\\nTaylor were already far on the road to the Swintons', James Westfall\\nwhipped up his horses and grew almost as thirsty for revenge as was his\\nwife.\\n\\nWhere the steer had been roasted, the powdered ashes were now cold\\nwhite, and Mr. McLean, feeling through his dreams the change of dawn\\ncome over the air, sat up cautiously among the outdoor slumberers and\\nwaked his neighbor.\\n\\n“Day will be soon,” he whispered, “and we must light out of this. I\\nnever suspicioned yu' had that much of the devil in you before.”\\n\\n“I reckon some of the fellows will act haidstrong,” the Virginian\\nmurmured luxuriously, among the warmth of his blankets.\\n\\n“I tell yu' we must skip,” said Lin, for the second time; and he rubbed\\nthe Virginian's black head, which alone was visible.\\n\\n“Skip, then, you,” came muffled from within, “and keep you'self mighty\\nsca'ce till they can appreciate our frolic.”\\n\\nThe Southerner withdrew deeper into his bed, and Mr. McLean, informing\\nhim that he was a fool, arose and saddled his horse. From the\\nsaddle-bag, he brought a parcel, and lightly laying this beside Bokay\\nBaldy, he mounted and was gone. When Baldy awoke later, he found the\\nparcel to be a pair of flowery slippers.\\n\\nIn selecting the inert Virginian as the fool, Mr. McLean was scarcely\\nwise; it is the absent who are always guilty.\\n\\nBefore ever Lin could have been a mile in retreat, the rattle of\\nthe wheels roused all of them, and here came the Taylors. Before the\\nTaylors' knocking had brought the Swintons to their door, other wheels\\nsounded, and here were Mr. and Mrs. Carmody, and Uncle Hughey with his\\nwife, and close after them Mr. Dow, alone, who told how his wife had\\ngone into one of her fits--she upon whom Dr. Barker at Drybone had\\nenjoined total abstinence from all excitement. Voices of women and\\nchildren began to be uplifted; the Westfalls arrived in a lather,\\nand the Thomases; and by sunrise, what with fathers and mothers and\\nspectators and loud offspring, there was gathered such a meeting as has\\nseldom been before among the generations of speaking men. To-day you can\\nhear legends of it from Texas to Montana; but I am giving you the full\\nparticulars.\\n\\nOf course they pitched upon poor Lin. Here was the Virginian doing\\nhis best, holding horses and helping ladies descend, while the name of\\nMcLean began to be muttered with threats. Soon a party led by Mr. Dow\\nset forth in search of him, and the Southerner debated a moment if he\\nhad better not put them on a wrong track. But he concluded that they\\nmight safely go on searching.\\n\\nMrs. Westfall found Christopher at once in the green shawl of Anna\\nMaria Dow, but all was not achieved thus in the twinkling of an eye. Mr.\\nMcLean had, it appeared, as James Westfall lugubriously pointed out, not\\nmerely “swapped the duds; he had shuffled the whole doggone deck;” and\\nthey cursed this Satanic invention. The fathers were but of moderate\\nassistance; it was the mothers who did the heavy work; and by ten\\no'clock some unsolved problems grew so delicate that a ladies' caucus\\nwas organized in a private room,--no admittance for men,--and what was\\ndone there I can only surmise.\\n\\nDuring its progress the search party returned. It had not found Mr.\\nMcLean. It had found a tree with a notice pegged upon it, reading, “God\\nbless our home!” This was captured.\\n\\nBut success attended the caucus; each mother emerged, satisfied that\\nshe had received her own, and each sire, now that his family was itself\\nagain, began to look at his neighbor sideways. After a man has been\\nangry enough to kill another man, after the fire of righteous slaughter\\nhas raged in his heart as it had certainly raged for several hours in\\nthe hearts of these fathers, the flame will usually burn itself out.\\nThis will be so in a generous nature, unless the cause of the anger is\\nstill unchanged. But the children had been identified; none had taken\\nhurt. All had been humanely given their nourishment. The thing was over.\\nThe day was beautiful. A tempting feast remained from the barbecue.\\nThese Bear Creek fathers could not keep their ire at red heat. Most\\nof them, being as yet more their wives' lovers than their children's\\nparents, began to see the mirthful side of the adventure; and they\\nceased to feel very severely toward Lin McLean.\\n\\nNot so the women. They cried for vengeance; but they cried in vain, and\\nwere met with smiles.\\n\\nMrs. Westfall argued long that punishment should be dealt the offender.\\n“Anyway,” she persisted, “it was real defiant of him putting that up on\\nthe tree. I might forgive him but for that.”\\n\\n“Yes,” spoke the Virginian in their midst, “that wasn't sort o' right.\\nEspecially as I am the man you're huntin'.”\\n\\nThey sat dumb at his assurance.\\n\\n“Come and kill me,” he continued, round upon the party. “I'll not\\nresist.”\\n\\nBut they could not resist the way in which he had looked round upon\\nthem. He had chosen the right moment for his confession, as a captain\\nof a horse awaits the proper time for a charge. Some rebukes he did\\nreceive; the worst came from the mothers. And all that he could say for\\nhimself was, “I am getting off too easy.”\\n\\n“But what was your point?” said Westfall.\\n\\n“Blamed if I know any more. I expect it must have been the whiskey.”\\n\\n“I would mind it less,” said Mrs. Westfall, “if you looked a bit sorry\\nor ashamed.”\\n\\nThe Virginian shook his head at her penitently. “I'm tryin' to,” he\\nsaid.\\n\\nAnd thus he sat disarming his accusers until they began to lunch upon\\nthe copious remnants of the barbecue. He did not join them at this meal.\\nIn telling you that Mrs. Dow was the only lady absent upon this historic\\nmorning, I was guilty of an inadvertence. There was one other.\\n\\nThe Virginian rode away sedately through the autumn sunshine; and as\\nhe went he asked his Monte horse a question. “Do yu' reckon she'll have\\nforgotten you too, you pie-biter?” said he. Instead of the new trousers,\\nthe cow-puncher's leathern chaps were on his legs. But he had the new\\nscarf knotted at his neck. Most men would gladly have equalled him in\\nappearance. “You Monte,” said he, “will she be at home?”\\n\\nIt was Sunday, and no school day, and he found her in her cabin that\\nstood next the Taylors' house. Her eyes were very bright.\\n\\n“I'd thought I'd just call,” said he.\\n\\n“Why, that's such a pity! Mr. and Mrs. Taylor are away.”\\n\\n“Yes; they've been right busy. That's why I thought I'd call. Will yu'\\ncome for a ride, ma'am?”\\n\\n“Dear me! I--”\\n\\n“You can ride my hawss. He's gentle.”\\n\\n“What! And you walk?”\\n\\n“No, ma'am. Nor the two of us ride him THIS time, either.” At this she\\nturned entirely pink, and he, noticing, went on quietly: “I'll catch up\\none of Taylor's hawsses. Taylor knows me.”\\n\\n“No. I don't really think I could do that. But thank you. Thank you very\\nmuch. I must go now and see how Mrs. Taylor's fire is.”\\n\\n“I'll look after that, ma'am. I'd like for yu' to go ridin' mighty well.\\nYu' have no babies this mawnin' to be anxious after.”\\n\\nAt this shaft, Grandmother Stark flashed awake deep within the spirit of\\nher descendant, and she made a haughty declaration of war. “I don't know\\nwhat you mean, sir,” she said.\\n\\nNow was his danger; for it was easy to fall into mere crude impertinence\\nand ask her why, then, did she speak thus abruptly? There were various\\neasy things of this kind for him to say. And any rudeness would have\\nlost him the battle. But the Virginian was not the man to lose such\\na battle in such a way. His shaft had hit. She thought he referred\\nto those babies about whom last night she had shown such superfluous\\nsolicitude. Her conscience was guilty. This was all that he had wished\\nto make sure of before he began operations.\\n\\n“Why, I mean,” said he, easily, sitting down near the door, “that it's\\nSunday. School don't hinder yu' from enjoyin' a ride to-day. You'll\\nteach the kids all the better for it to-morro', ma'am. Maybe it's your\\nduty.” And he smiled at her.\\n\\n“My duty! It's quite novel to have strangers--”\\n\\n“Am I a stranger?” he cut in, firing his first broadside. “I was\\nintroduced, ma'am,” he continued, noting how she had flushed again. “And\\nI would not be oversteppin' for the world. I'll go away if yu' want.”\\n And hereupon he quietly rose, and stood, hat in hand.\\n\\nMolly was flustered. She did not at all want him to go. No one of\\nher admirers had ever been like this creature. The fringed leathern\\nchaparreros, the cartridge belt, the flannel shirt, the knotted scarf at\\nthe neck, these things were now an old story to her. Since her arrival\\nshe had seen young men and old in plenty dressed thus. But worn by this\\nman now standing by her door, they seemed to radiate romance. She did\\nnot want him to go--and she wished to win her battle. And now in\\nher agitation she became suddenly severe, as she had done at Hoosic\\nJunction. He should have a punishment to remember!\\n\\n“You call yourself a man, I suppose,” she said.\\n\\nBut he did not tremble in the least. Her fierceness filled him with\\ndelight, and the tender desire of ownership flooded through him.\\n\\n“A grown-up, responsible man,” she repeated.\\n\\n“Yes, ma'am. I think so.” He now sat down again.\\n\\n“And you let them think that--that Mr. McLean--You dare not look me in\\nthe face and say that Mr. McLean did that last night!”\\n\\n“I reckon I dassent.”\\n\\n“There! I knew it! I said so from the first!”\\n\\n“And me a stranger to you!” he murmured.\\n\\nIt was his second broadside. It left her badly crippled. She was silent.\\n\\n“Who did yu' mention it to, ma'am?”\\n\\nShe hoped she had him. “Why, are you afraid?” And she laughed lightly.\\n\\n“I told 'em myself. And their astonishment seemed so genu-wine I'd just\\nhate to think they had fooled me that thorough when they knowed it all\\nalong from you seeing me.”\\n\\n“I did not see you. I knew it must--of course I did not tell any one.\\nWhen I said I said so from the first, I meant--you can understand\\nperfectly what I meant.”\\n\\n“Yes, ma'am.”\\n\\nPoor Molly was near stamping her foot. “And what sort of a trick,” she\\nrushed on, “was that to play? Do you call it a manly thing to frighten\\nand distress women because you--for no reason at all? I should never\\nhave imagined it could be the act of a person who wears a big pistol and\\nrides a big horse. I should be afraid to go riding with such an immature\\nprotector.”\\n\\n“Yes; that was awful childish. Your words do cut a little; for maybe\\nthere's been times when I have acted pretty near like a man. But I\\ncert'nly forgot to be introduced before I spoke to yu' last night.\\nBecause why? You've found me out dead in one thing. Won't you take a\\nguess at this too?”\\n\\n“I cannot sit guessing why people do not behave themselves--who seem to\\nknow better.”\\n\\n“Well, ma'am, I've played square and owned up to yu'. And that's not\\nwhat you're doin' by me. I ask your pardon if I say what I have a right\\nto say in language not as good as I'd like to talk to yu' with. But at\\nSouth Fork Crossin' who did any introducin'? Did yu' complain I was a\\nstranger then?”\\n\\n“I--no!” she flashed out; then, quite sweetly, “The driver told me it\\nwasn't REALLY so dangerous there, you know.”\\n\\n“That's not the point I'm makin'. You are a grown-up woman, a\\nresponsible woman. You've come ever so far, and all alone, to a\\nrough country to instruct young children that play games,--tag, and\\nhide-and-seek, and fooleries they'll have to quit when they get old.\\nDon't you think pretendin' yu' don't know a man,--his name's nothin',\\nbut him,--a man whom you were glad enough to let assist yu' when\\nsomebody was needed,--don't you think that's mighty close to\\nhide-and-seek them children plays? I ain't so sure but what there's a\\npair of us children in this hyeh room.”\\n\\nMolly Wood was regarding him saucily. “I don't think I like you,” said\\nshe.\\n\\n“That's all square enough. You're goin' to love me before we get\\nthrough. I wish yu'd come a-ridin, ma'am.”\\n\\n“Dear, dear, dear! So I'm going to love you? How will you do it? I know\\nmen think that they only need to sit and look strong and make chests at\\na girl--”\\n\\n“Goodness gracious! I ain't makin' any chests at yu'!” Laughter overcame\\nhim for a moment, and Miss Wood liked his laugh very much. “Please come\\na-ridin',” he urged. “It's the prettiest kind of a day.”\\n\\nShe looked at him frankly, and there was a pause. “I will take back two\\nthings that I said to you,” she then answered him. “I believe that I do\\nlike you. And I know that if I went riding with you, I should not\\nhave an immature protector.” And then, with a final gesture of\\nacknowledgment, she held out her hand to him. “And I have always\\nwanted,” she said, “to thank you for what you did at the river.”\\n\\nHe took her hand, and his heart bounded. “You're a gentleman!” he\\nexclaimed.\\n\\nIt was now her turn to be overcome with merriment. “I've always wanted\\nto be a man,” she said.\\n\\n“I am mighty glad you ain't,” said he, looking at her.\\n\\nBut Molly had already received enough broadsides for one day. She could\\nallow no more of them, and she took herself capably in hand. “Where did\\nyou learn to make such pretty speeches?” she asked. “Well, never mind\\nthat. One sees that you have had plenty of practice for one so young.”\\n\\n“I am twenty-seven,” blurted the Virginian, and knew instantly that he\\nhad spoken like a fool.\\n\\n“Who would have dreamed it!” said Molly, with well-measured mockery. She\\nknew that she had scored at last, and that this day was hers. “Don't\\nbe too sure you are glad I'm not a man,” she now told him. There was\\nsomething like a challenge in her voice.\\n\\n“I risk it,” he remarked.\\n\\n“For I am almost twenty-three myself,” she concluded. And she gave him a\\nlook on her own account.\\n\\n“And you'll not come a-ridin'?” he persisted.\\n\\n“No,” she answered him; “no.” And he knew that he could not make her.\\n\\n“Then I will tell yu' good-by,” said he. “But I am comin' again. And\\nnext time I'll have along a gentle hawss for yu'.”\\n\\n“Next time! Next time! Well, perhaps I will go with you. Do you live\\nfar?”\\n\\n“I live on Judge Henry's ranch, over yondeh.” He pointed across the\\nmountains. “It's on Sunk Creek. A pretty rough trail; but I can come\\nhyeh to see you in a day, I reckon. Well, I hope you'll cert'nly enjoy\\ngood health, ma'am.”\\n\\n“Oh, there's one thing!” said Molly Wood, calling after him rather\\nquickly. “I--I'm not at all afraid of horses. You needn't bring such\\na gentle one. I--was very tired that day, and--and I don't scream as a\\nrule.”\\n\\nHe turned and looked at her so that she could not meet his glance.\\n“Bless your heart!” said he. “Will yu' give me one o' those flowers?”\\n\\n“Oh, certainly! I'm always so glad when people like them.”\\n\\n“They're pretty near the color of your eyes.”\\n\\n“Never mind my eyes.”\\n\\n“Can't help it, ma'am. Not since South Fork.”\\n\\nHe put the flower in the leather band of his hat, and rode away on his\\nMonte horse. Miss Wood lingered a moment, then made some steps toward\\nher gate, from which he could still be seen; and then, with something\\nlike a toss of the head, she went in and shut her door.\\n\\nLater in the day the Virginian met Mr. McLean, who looked at his hat and\\ninnocently quoted, “'My Looloo picked a daisy.'”\\n\\n“Don't yu', Lin,” said the Southerner.\\n\\n“Then I won't,” said Lin.\\n\\nThus, for this occasion, did the Virginian part from his lady--and\\nnothing said one way or another about the handkerchief that had\\ndisappeared during the South Fork incident.\\n\\nAs we fall asleep at night, our thoughts will often ramble back and\\nforth between the two worlds.\\n\\n“What color were his eyes?” wondered Molly on her pillow. “His mustache\\nis not bristly like so many of them. Sam never gave me such a look\\nat Hoosic Junction. No.... You can't come with me.... Get off your\\nhorse.... The passengers are all staring....”\\n\\nAnd while Molly was thus dreaming that the Virginian had ridden his\\nhorse into the railroad car, and sat down beside her, the fire in the\\ngreat stone chimney of her cabin flickered quietly, its gleams now and\\nagain touching the miniature of Grandmother Stark upon the wall.\\n\\nCamped on the Sunk Creek trail, the Virginian was telling himself in his\\nblankets: “I ain't too old for education. Maybe she will lend me books.\\nAnd I'll watch her ways and learn...stand still, Monte. I can learn a\\nlot more than the kids on that. There's Monte...you pie-biter, stop....\\nHe has ate up your book, ma'am, but I'll get yu'...”\\n\\nAnd then the Virginian was fast asleep.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXII. QUALITY AND EQUALITY\\n\\n\\nTo the circle at Bennington, a letter from Bear Creek was always a\\nwelcome summons to gather and hear of doings very strange to Vermont.\\nAnd when the tale of the changed babies arrived duly by the post, it\\ncreated a more than usual sensation, and was read to a large number of\\npleased and scandalized neighbors. “I hate her to be where such things\\ncan happen,” said Mrs. Wood.\\n\\n“I wish I could have been there,” said her son-in-law, Andrew Bell.\\n\\n“She does not mention who played the trick,” said Mrs. Andrew Bell.\\n\\n“We shouldn't be any wiser if she did,” said Mrs. Wood.\\n\\n“I'd like to meet the perpetrator,” said Andrew.\\n\\n“Oh, no!” said Mrs. Wood. “They're all horrible.”\\n\\nAnd she wrote at once, begging her daughter to take good care of\\nherself, and to see as much of Mrs. Balaam as possible. “And of any\\nother ladies that are near you. For you seem to me to be in a community\\nof roughs. I wish you would give it all up. Did you expect me to laugh\\nabout the babies?”\\n\\nMrs. Flynt, when this story was repeated to her (she had not been\\ninvited in to hear the letter), remarked that she had always felt that\\nMolly Wood must be a little vulgar, ever since she began to go about\\ngiving music lessons like any ordinary German.\\n\\nBut Mrs. Wood was considerably relieved when the next letter arrived. It\\ncontained nothing horrible about barbecues or babies. It mentioned the\\ngreat beauty of the weather, and how well and strong the fine air was\\nmaking the writer feel. And it asked that books might be sent, many\\nbooks of all sorts, novels, poetry, all the good old books and any good\\nnew ones that could be spared. Cheap editions, of course.\\n\\n“Indeed she shall have them!” said Mrs. Wood. “How her mind must be\\nstarving in that dreadful place!” The letter was not a long one, and,\\nbesides the books, spoke of little else except the fine weather and\\nthe chances for outdoor exercise that this gave. “You have no idea,”\\n it said, “how delightful it is to ride, especially on a spirited horse,\\nwhich I can do now quite well.”\\n\\n“How nice that is!” said Mrs. Wood, putting down the letter. “I hope the\\nhorse is not too spirited.”\\n\\n“Who does she go riding with?” asked Mrs. Bell.\\n\\n“She doesn't say, Sarah. Why?”\\n\\n“Nothing. She has a queer way of not mentioning things, now and then.”\\n\\n“Sarah!” exclaimed Mrs. Wood, reproachfully. “Oh, well, mother, you\\nknow just as well as I do that she can be very independent and\\nunconventional.”\\n\\n“Yes; but not in that way. She wouldn't ride with poor Sam Bannett, and\\nafter all he is a suitable person.”\\n\\nNevertheless, in her next letter, Mrs. Wood cautioned her daughter about\\ntrusting herself with any one of whom Mrs. Balaam did not thoroughly\\napprove. The good lady could never grasp that Mrs. Balaam lived a long\\nday's journey from Bear Creek, and that Molly saw her about once every\\nthree months. “We have sent your books,” the mother wrote; “everybody\\nhas contributed from their store,--Shakespeare, Tennyson, Browning,\\nLongfellow; and a number of novels by Scott, Thackeray, George Eliot,\\nHawthorne, and lesser writers; some volumes of Emerson; and Jane Austen\\ncomplete, because you admire her so particularly.”\\n\\nThis consignment of literature reached Bear Creek about a week before\\nChristmas time.\\n\\nBy New Year's Day, the Virginian had begun his education.\\n\\n“Well, I have managed to get through 'em,” he said, as he entered\\nMolly's cabin in February. And he laid two volumes upon her table.\\n\\n“And what do you think of them?” she inquired.\\n\\n“I think that I've cert'nly earned a good long ride to-day.”\\n\\n“Georgie Taylor has sprained his ankle.”\\n\\n“No, I don't mean that kind of a ride. I've earned a ride with just us\\ntwo alone. I've read every word of both of 'em, yu' know.”\\n\\n“I'll think about it. Did you like them?”\\n\\n“No. Not much. If I'd knowed that one was a detective story, I'd have\\ngot yu' to try something else on me. Can you guess the murderer, or is\\nthe author too smart for yu'? That's all they amount to. Well, he was\\ntoo smart for me this time, but that didn't distress me any. That other\\nbook talks too much.”\\n\\nMolly was scandalized, and she told him it was a great work.\\n\\n“Oh, yes, yes. A fine book. But it will keep up its talkin'. Don't let\\nyou alone.”\\n\\n“Didn't you feel sorry for poor Maggie Tulliver?”\\n\\n“Hmp. Yes. Sorry for her, and for Tawmmy, too. But the man did right to\\ndrownd 'em both.”\\n\\n“It wasn't a man. A woman wrote that.”\\n\\n“A woman did! Well, then, o' course she talks too much.”\\n\\n“I'll not go riding with you!” shrieked Molly.\\n\\nBut she did. And he returned to Sunk Creek, not with a detective story,\\nbut this time with a Russian novel.\\n\\nIt was almost April when he brought it back to her--and a heavy sleet\\nstorm lost them their ride. So he spent his time indoors with her, not\\nspeaking a syllable of love. When he came to take his departure, he\\nasked her for some other book by this same Russian. But she had no more.\\n\\n“I wish you had,” he said. “I've never saw a book could tell the truth\\nlike that one does.”\\n\\n“Why, what do you like about it?” she exclaimed. To her it had been\\ndistasteful.\\n\\n“Everything,” he answered. “That young come-outer, and his fam'ly that\\ncan't understand him--for he is broad gauge, yu' see, and they are\\nnarro' gauge.” The Virginian looked at Molly a moment almost shyly. “Do\\nyou know,” he said, and a blush spread over his face, “I pretty near\\ncried when that young come-outer was dyin', and said about himself,\\n'I was a giant.' Life made him broad gauge, yu' see, and then took his\\nchance away.”\\n\\nMolly liked the Virginian for his blush. It made him very handsome. But\\nshe thought that it came from his confession about “pretty near crying.”\\n The deeper cause she failed to divine,--that he, like the dying hero in\\nthe novel, felt himself to be a giant whom life had made “broad gauge,”\\n and denied opportunity. Fecund nature begets and squanders thousands of\\nthese rich seeds in the wilderness of life.\\n\\nHe took away with him a volume of Shakespeare. “I've saw good plays of\\nhis,” he remarked.\\n\\nKind Mrs. Taylor in her cabin next door watched him ride off in the\\nsleet, bound for the lonely mountain trail.\\n\\n“If that girl don't get ready to take him pretty soon,” she observed to\\nher husband, “I'll give her a piece of my mind.”\\n\\nTaylor was astonished. “Is he thinking of her?” he inquired.\\n\\n“Lord, Mr. Taylor, and why shouldn't he?”\\n\\nMr. Taylor scratched his head and returned to his newspaper.\\n\\nIt was warm--warm and beautiful upon Bear Creek. Snow shone upon\\nthe peaks of the Bow Leg range; lower on their slopes the pines were\\nstirring with a gentle song; and flowers bloomed across the wide plains\\nat their feet.\\n\\nMolly and her Virginian sat at a certain spring where he had often\\nridden with her. On this day he was bidding her farewell before\\nundertaking the most important trust which Judge Henry had as yet given\\nhim. For this journey she had provided him with Sir Walter Scott's\\nKenilworth. Shakespeare he had returned to her. He had bought\\nShakespeare for himself. “As soon as I got used to readin' it,” he had\\ntold her, “I knowed for certain that I liked readin' for enjoyment.”\\n\\nBut it was not of books that he had spoken much to-day. He had not\\nspoken at all. He had bade her listen to the meadow-lark, when its song\\nfell upon the silence like beaded drops of music. He had showed her\\nwhere a covey of young willow-grouse were hiding as their horses passed.\\nAnd then, without warning, as they sat by the spring, he had spoken\\npotently of his love.\\n\\nShe did not interrupt him. She waited until he was wholly finished.\\n\\n“I am not the sort of wife you want,” she said, with an attempt of\\nairiness.\\n\\nHe answered roughly, “I am the judge of that.” And his roughness was a\\npleasure to her, yet it made her afraid of herself. When he was absent\\nfrom her, and she could sit in her cabin and look at Grandmother Stark,\\nand read home letters, then in imagination she found it easy to play\\nthe part which she had arranged to play regarding him--the part of the\\nguide, and superior, and indulgent companion. But when he was by her\\nside, that part became a difficult one. Her woman's fortress was shaken\\nby a force unknown to her before. Sam Bannett did not have it in him to\\nlook as this man could look, when the cold lustre of his eyes grew hot\\nwith internal fire. What color they were baffled her still. “Can it\\npossibly change?” she wondered. It seemed to her that sometimes when she\\nhad been looking from a rock straight down into clear sea water, this\\nsame color had lurked in its depths. “Is it green, or is it gray?”\\n she asked herself, but did not turn just now to see. She kept her face\\ntoward the landscape.\\n\\n“All men are born equal,” he now remarked slowly.\\n\\n“Yes,” she quickly answered, with a combative flash. “Well?”\\n\\n“Maybe that don't include women?” he suggested.\\n\\n“I think it does.”\\n\\n“Do yu' tell the kids so?”\\n\\n“Of course I teach them what I believe!”\\n\\nHe pondered. “I used to have to learn about the Declaration of\\nIndependence. I hated books and truck when I was a kid.”\\n\\n“But you don't any more.”\\n\\n“No. I cert'nly don't. But I used to get kep' in at recess for bein' so\\ndumb. I was most always at the tail end of the class. My brother, he'd\\nbe head sometimes.”\\n\\n“Little George Taylor is my prize scholar,” said Molly.\\n\\n“Knows his tasks, does he?”\\n\\n“Always. And Henry Dow comes next.”\\n\\n“Who's last?”\\n\\n“Poor Bob Carmody. I spend more time on him than on all the rest put\\ntogether.”\\n\\n“My!” said the Virginian. “Ain't that strange!”\\n\\nShe looked at him, puzzled by his tone. “It's not strange when you know\\nBob,” she said.\\n\\n“It's very strange,” drawled the Virginian. “Knowin' Bob don't help it\\nany.”\\n\\n“I don't think that I understand you,” said Molly, sticky.\\n\\n“Well, it is mighty confusin'. George Taylor, he's your best scholar,\\nand poor Bob, he's your worst, and there's a lot in the middle--and you\\ntell me we're all born equal!”\\n\\nMolly could only sit giggling in this trap he had so ingeniously laid\\nfor her.\\n\\n“I'll tell you what,” pursued the cow-puncher, with slow and growing\\nintensity, “equality is a great big bluff. It's easy called.”\\n\\n“I didn't mean--” began Molly.\\n\\n“Wait, and let me say what I mean.” He had made an imperious gesture\\nwith his hand. “I know a man that mostly wins at cyards. I know a man\\nthat mostly loses. He says it is his luck. All right. Call it his luck.\\nI know a man that works hard and he's gettin' rich, and I know another\\nthat works hard and is gettin' poor. He says it is his luck. All right.\\nCall it his luck. I look around and I see folks movin' up or movin'\\ndown, winners or losers everywhere. All luck, of course. But since folks\\ncan be born that different in their luck, where's your equality? No,\\nseh! call your failure luck, or call it laziness, wander around the\\nwords, prospect all yu' mind to, and yu'll come out the same old trail\\nof inequality.” He paused a moment and looked at her. “Some holds four\\naces,” he went on, “and some holds nothin', and some poor fello' gets\\nthe aces and no show to play 'em; but a man has got to prove himself my\\nequal before I'll believe him.”\\n\\nMolly sat gazing at him, silent.\\n\\n“I know what yu' meant,” he told her now, “by sayin' you're not the wife\\nI'd want. But I am the kind that moves up. I am goin' to be your best\\nscholar.” He turned toward her, and that fortress within her began to\\nshake.\\n\\n“Don't,” she murmured. “Don't, please.”\\n\\n“Don't what?”\\n\\n“Why--spoil this.”\\n\\n“Spoil it?”\\n\\n“These rides--I don't love you--I can't--but these rides are--”\\n\\n“What are they?”\\n\\n“My greatest pleasure. There! And, please, I want them to go on so.”\\n\\n“Go on so! I don't reckon yu' know what you're sayin'. Yu' might as well\\nask fruit to stay green. If the way we are now can keep bein' enough\\nfor you, it can't for me. A pleasure to you, is it? Well, to me it is--I\\ndon't know what to call it. I come to yu' and I hate it, and I come\\nagain and I hate it, and I ache and grieve all over when I go. No!\\nYou will have to think of some other way than just invitin' me to keep\\ngreen.”\\n\\n“If I am to see you--” began the girl.\\n\\n“You're not to see me. Not like this. I can stay away easier than what I\\nam doin'.”\\n\\n“Will you do me a favor, a great one?” said she, now.\\n\\n“Make it as impossible as you please!” he cried. He thought it was to be\\nsome action.\\n\\n“Go on coming. But don't talk to me about--don't talk in that way--if\\nyou can help it.”\\n\\nHe laughed out, not permitting himself to swear.\\n\\n“But,” she continued, “if you can't help talking that way--sometimes--I\\npromise I will listen. That is the only promise I make.”\\n\\n“That is a bargain,” he said.\\n\\nThen he helped her mount her horse, restraining himself like a Spartan,\\nand they rode home to her cabin.\\n\\n“You have made it pretty near impossible,” he said, as he took his\\nleave. “But you've been square to-day, and I'll show you I can be square\\nwhen I come back. I'll not do more than ask you if your mind's the same.\\nAnd now I'll not see you for quite a while. I am going a long way. But\\nI'll be very busy. And bein' busy always keeps me from grievin' too much\\nabout you.”\\n\\nStrange is woman! She would rather have heard some other last remark\\nthan this.\\n\\n“Oh, very well!” she said. “I'll not miss you either.”\\n\\nHe smiled at her. “I doubt if yu' can help missin' me,” he remarked. And\\nhe was gone at once, galloping on his Monte horse.\\n\\nWhich of the two won a victory this day?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXIII. THE GAME AND THE NATION--ACT FIRST\\n\\n\\nThere can be no doubt of this: All America is divided into two\\nclasses,--the quality and the equality.\\n\\nThe latter will always recognize the former when mistaken for it. Both\\nwill be with us until our women bear nothing but kings.\\n\\nIt was through the Declaration of Independence that we Americans\\nacknowledged the ETERNAL INEQUALITY of man. For by it we abolished a\\ncut-and-dried aristocracy. We had seen little men artificially held up\\nin high places, and great men artificially held down in low places, and\\nour own justice-loving hearts abhorred this violence to human nature.\\nTherefore, we decreed that every man should thenceforth have equal\\nliberty to find his own level. By this very decree we acknowledged and\\ngave freedom to true aristocracy, saying, “Let the best man win, whoever\\nhe is.” Let the best man win! That is America's word. That is true\\ndemocracy. And true democracy and true aristocracy are one and the same\\nthing. If anybody cannot see this, so much the worse for his eyesight.\\n\\nThe above reflections occurred to me before reaching Billings, Montana,\\nsome three weeks after I had unexpectedly met the Virginian at Omaha,\\nNebraska. I had not known of that trust given to him by Judge Henry,\\nwhich was taking him East. I was looking to ride with him before long\\namong the clean hills of Sunk Creek. I supposed he was there. But I came\\nupon him one morning in Colonel Cyrus Jones's eating palace.\\n\\nDid you know the palace? It stood in Omaha, near the trains, and it was\\nten years old (which is middle-aged in Omaha) when I first saw it. It\\nwas a shell of wood, painted with golden emblems,--the steamboat, the\\neagle, the Yosemite,--and a live bear ate gratuities at its entrance.\\nWeather permitting, it opened upon the world as a stage upon the\\naudience. You sat in Omaha's whole sight and dined, while Omaha's dust\\ncame and settled upon the refreshments. It is gone the way of the Indian\\nand the buffalo, for the West is growing old. You should have seen the\\npalace and sat there. In front of you passed rainbows of men,--Chinese,\\nIndian chiefs, Africans, General Miles, younger sons, Austrian nobility,\\nwide females in pink. Our continent drained prismatically through Omaha\\nonce.\\n\\nSo I was passing that way also, walking for the sake of ventilation from\\na sleeping-car toward a bath, when the language of Colonel Cyrus Jones\\ncame out to me. The actual colonel I had never seen before. He stood\\nat the rear of his palace in gray flowery mustaches and a Confederate\\nuniform, telling the wishes of his guests to the cook through a hole.\\nYou always bought meal tickets at once, else you became unwelcome.\\nGuests here had foibles at times, and a rapid exit was too easy.\\nTherefore I bought a ticket. It was spring and summer since I had heard\\nanything like the colonel. The Missouri had not yet flowed into New York\\ndialect freely, and his vocabulary met me like the breeze of the plains.\\nSo I went in to be fanned by it, and there sat the Virginian at a table,\\nalone.\\n\\nHis greeting was up to the code of indifference proper on the plains;\\nbut he presently remarked, “I'm right glad to see somebody,” which was a\\ngood deal to say. “Them that comes hyeh,” he observed next, “don't eat.\\nThey feed.” And he considered the guests with a sombre attention.\\n“D' yu' reckon they find joyful digestion in this swallo'-an'-get-out\\ntrough?”\\n\\n“What are you doing here, then?” said I.\\n\\n“Oh, pshaw! When yu' can't have what you choose, yu' just choose what\\nyou have.” And he took the bill-of-fare. I began to know that he had\\nsomething on his mind, so I did not trouble him further.\\n\\nMeanwhile he sat studying the bill-of-fare.\\n\\n“Ever heard o' them?” he inquired, shoving me the spotted document.\\n\\nMost improbable dishes were there,--salmis, canapes, supremes,--all\\nperfectly spelt and absolutely transparent. It was the old trick of\\ncopying some metropolitan menu to catch travellers of the third and last\\ndimension of innocence; and whenever this is done the food is of the\\nthird and last dimension of awfulness, which the cow-puncher knew as\\nwell as anybody.\\n\\n“So they keep that up here still,” I said.\\n\\n“But what about them?” he repeated. His finger was at a special item,\\nFROGS' LEGS A LA DELMONICO. “Are they true anywheres?” he asked. And I\\ntold him, certainly. I also explained to him about Delmonico of New York\\nand about Augustin of Philadelphia.\\n\\n“There's not a little bit o' use in lyin' to me this mawnin',” he said,\\nwith his engaging smile. “I ain't goin' to awdeh anything's laigs.”\\n\\n“Well, I'll see how he gets out of it,” I said, remembering the odd\\nTexas legend. (The traveller read the bill-of-fare, you know, and called\\nfor a vol-au-vent. And the proprietor looked at the traveller, and\\nrunning a pistol into his ear, observed, “You'll take hash.”) I was\\nthinking of this and wondering what would happen to me. So I took the\\nstep.\\n\\n“Wants frogs' legs, does he?” shouted Colonel Cyrus Jones. He fixed\\nhis eye upon me, and it narrowed to a slit. “Too many brain workers\\nbreakfasting before yu' came in, professor,” said he. “Missionary ate\\nthe last leg off me just now. Brown the wheat!” he commanded, through\\nthe hole to the cook, for some one had ordered hot cakes.\\n\\n“I'll have fried aiggs,” said the Virginian. “Cooked both sides.”\\n\\n“White wings!” sang the colonel through the hole. “Let 'em fly up and\\ndown.”\\n\\n“Coffee an' no milk,” said the Virginian.\\n\\n“Draw one in the dark!” the colonel roared.\\n\\n“And beefsteak, rare.”\\n\\n“One slaughter in the pan, and let the blood drip!”\\n\\n“I should like a glass of water, please,” said I. The colonel threw me a\\nlook of pity.\\n\\n“One Missouri and ice for the professor!” he said.\\n\\n“That fello's a right live man,” commented the Virginian. But he seemed\\nthoughtful. Presently he inquired, “Yu' say he was a foreigner, an'\\nlearned fancy cookin' to New Yawk?”\\n\\nThat was this cow-puncher's way. Scarcely ever would he let drop a thing\\nnew to him until he had got from you your whole information about it.\\nSo I told him the history of Lorenzo Delmonico and his pioneer work, as\\nmuch as I knew, and the Southerner listened intently.\\n\\n“Mighty inter-estin',” he said--“mighty. He could just take little\\nold o'rn'ry frawgs, and dandy 'em up to suit the bloods. Mighty\\ninter-estin'. I expaict, though, his cookin' would give an outraiged\\nstomach to a plain-raised man.”\\n\\n“If you want to follow it up,” said I, by way of a sudden experiment,\\n“Miss Molly Wood might have some book about French dishes.”\\n\\nBut the Virginian did not turn a hair. “I reckon she wouldn't,” he\\nanswered. “She was raised in Vermont. They don't bother overly about\\ntheir eatin' up in Vermont. Hyeh's what Miss Wood recommended the las'\\ntime I was seein' her,” the cow-puncher added, bringing Kenilworth from\\nhis pocket. “Right fine story. That Queen Elizabeth must have cert'nly\\nbeen a competent woman.”\\n\\n“She was,” said I. But talk came to an end here. A dusty crew, most\\nevidently from the plains, now entered and drifted to a table; and each\\nman of them gave the Virginian about a quarter of a slouchy nod. His\\ngreeting to them was very serene. Only, Kenilworth went back into his\\npocket, and he breakfasted in silence. Among those who had greeted him I\\nnow recognized a face.\\n\\n“Why, that's the man you played cards with at Medicine Bow!” I said.\\n\\n“Yes. Trampas. He's got a job at the ranch now.” The Virginian said no\\nmore, but went on with his breakfast.\\n\\nHis appearance was changed. Aged I would scarcely say, for this\\nwould seem as if he did not look young. But I think that the boy was\\naltogether gone from his face--the boy whose freak with Steve had turned\\nMedicine Bow upside down, whose other freak with the babies had outraged\\nBear Creek, the boy who had loved to jingle his spurs. But manhood had\\nonly trained, not broken, his youth. It was all there, only obedient to\\nthe rein and curb.\\n\\nPresently we went together to the railway yard.\\n\\n“The Judge is doing a right smart o' business this year,” he began, very\\ncasually indeed, so that I knew this was important. Besides bells and\\ncoal smoke, the smell and crowded sounds of cattle rose in the air\\naround us. “Hyeh's our first gather o' beeves on the ranch,” continued\\nthe Virginian. “The whole lot's shipped through to Chicago in two\\nsections over the Burlington. The Judge is fighting the Elkhorn road.”\\n We passed slowly along the two trains,--twenty cars, each car packed\\nwith huddled, round-eyed, gazing steers. He examined to see if any\\nanimals were down. “They ain't ate or drank anything to speak of,” he\\nsaid, while the terrified brutes stared at us through their slats. “Not\\nsince they struck the railroad they've not drank. Yu' might suppose\\nthey know somehow what they're travellin' to Chicago for.” And casually,\\nalways casually, he told me the rest. Judge Henry could not spare his\\nforeman away from the second gather of beeves. Therefore these two\\nten-car trains with their double crew of cow-boys had been given to the\\nVirginian's charge. After Chicago, he was to return by St. Paul over\\nthe Northern Pacific; for the Judge had wished him to see certain of the\\nroad's directors and explain to them persuasively how good a thing it\\nwould be for them to allow especially cheap rates to the Sunk Creek\\noutfit henceforth. This was all the Virginian told me; and it contained\\nthe whole matter, to be sure.\\n\\n“So you're acting foreman,” said I.\\n\\n“Why, somebody has to have the say, I reckon.”\\n\\n“And of course you hated the promotion?”\\n\\n“I don't know about promotion,” he replied. “The boys have been used\\nto seein' me one of themselves. Why don't you come along with us far as\\nPlattsmouth?” Thus he shifted the subject from himself, and called to my\\nnotice the locomotives backing up to his cars, and reminded me that from\\nPlattsmouth I had the choice of two trains returning. But he could not\\nhide or belittle this confidence of his employer in him. It was the care\\nof several thousand perishable dollars and the control of men. It was a\\ncompliment. There were more steers than men to be responsible for; but\\nnone of the steers had been suddenly picked from the herd and set above\\nhis fellows. Moreover, Chicago finished up the steers; but the new-made\\ndeputy foreman had then to lead his six highly unoccupied brethren away\\nfrom towns, and back in peace to the ranch, or disappoint the Judge, who\\nneeded their services. These things sometimes go wrong in a land where\\nthey say you are all born equal; and that quarter of a nod in Colonel\\nCyrus Jones's eating palace held more equality than any whole nod you\\ncould see. But the Virginian did not see it, there being a time for all\\nthings.\\n\\nWe trundled down the flopping, heavy-eddied Missouri to Plattsmouth,\\nand there they backed us on to a siding, the Christian Endeavor being\\nexpected to pass that way. And while the equality absorbed themselves in\\na deep but harmless game of poker by the side of the railway line,\\nthe Virginian and I sat on the top of a car, contemplating the sandy\\nshallows of the Platte.\\n\\n“I should think you'd take a hand,” said I.\\n\\n“Poker? With them kittens?” One flash of the inner man lightened in his\\neyes and died away, and he finished with his gentle drawl, “When I play,\\nI want it to be interestin'.” He took out Sir Walter's Kenilworth once\\nmore, and turned the volume over and over slowly, without opening it.\\nYou cannot tell if in spirit he wandered on Bear Creek with the girl\\nwhose book it was. The spirit will go one road, and the thought another,\\nand the body its own way sometimes. “Queen Elizabeth would have played a\\nmighty pow'ful game,” was his next remark.\\n\\n“Poker?” said I.\\n\\n“Yes, seh. Do you expaict Europe has got any queen equal to her at\\npresent?”\\n\\nI doubted it.\\n\\n“Victoria'd get pretty nigh slain sliding chips out agaynst Elizabeth.\\nOnly mos' prob'ly Victoria she'd insist on a half-cent limit. You have\\nread this hyeh Kenilworth? Well, deal Elizabeth ace high, an' she could\\nscare Robert Dudley with a full house plumb out o' the bettin'.”\\n\\nI said that I believed she unquestionably could.\\n\\n“And,” said the Virginian, “if Essex's play got next her too near, I\\nreckon she'd have stacked the cyards. Say, d' yu' remember Shakespeare's\\nfat man?”\\n\\n“Falstaff? Oh, yes, indeed.”\\n\\n“Ain't that grand? Why, he makes men talk the way they do in life.\\nI reckon he couldn't get printed to-day. It's a right down shame\\nShakespeare couldn't know about poker. He'd have had Falstaff playing\\nall day at that Tearsheet outfit. And the Prince would have beat him.”\\n\\n“The Prince had the brains,” said I.\\n\\n“Brains?”\\n\\n“Well, didn't he?”\\n\\n“I neveh thought to notice. Like as not he did.”\\n\\n“And Falstaff didn't, I suppose?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes, seh! Falstaff could have played whist.”\\n\\n“I suppose you know what you're talking about; I don't,” said I, for he\\nwas drawling again.\\n\\nThe cow-puncher's eye rested a moment amiably upon me. “You can play\\nwhist with your brains,” he mused,--“brains and cyards. Now cyards are\\nonly one o' the manifestations of poker in this hyeh world. One o' the\\nshapes yu fool with it in when the day's work is oveh. If a man is built\\nlike that Prince boy was built (and it's away down deep beyond brains),\\nhe'll play winnin' poker with whatever hand he's holdin' when the\\ntrouble begins. Maybe it will be a mean, triflin' army, or an empty\\nsix-shooter, or a lame hawss, or maybe just nothin' but his natural\\ncountenance. 'Most any old thing will do for a fello' like that Prince\\nboy to play poker with.”\\n\\n“Then I'd be grateful for your definition of poker,” said I.\\n\\nAgain the Virginian looked me over amiably. “You put up a mighty pretty\\ngame o' whist yourself,” he remarked. “Don't that give you the contented\\nspirit?” And before I had any reply to this, the Christian Endeavor\\nbegan to come over the bridge. Three instalments crossed the Missouri\\nfrom Pacific Junction, bound for Pike's Peak, every car swathed in\\nbright bunting, and at each window a Christian with a handkerchief,\\njoyously shrieking. Then the cattle trains got the open signal, and I\\njumped off. “Tell the Judge the steers was all right this far,” said the\\nVirginian.\\n\\nThat was the last of the deputy foreman for a while.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXIV. BETWEEN THE ACTS\\n\\n\\nMy road to Sunk Creek lay in no straight line. By rail I diverged\\nnorthwest to Fort Meade, and thence, after some stay with the kind\\nmilitary people, I made my way on a horse. Up here in the Black Hills it\\nsluiced rain most intolerably. The horse and I enjoyed the country and\\nourselves but little; and when finally I changed from the saddle into a\\nstagecoach, I caught a thankful expression upon the animal's face, and\\nreturned the same.\\n\\n“Six legs inside this jerky to-night?” said somebody, as I climbed\\nthe wheel. “Well, we'll give thanks for not havin' eight,” he added\\ncheerfully. “Clamp your mind on to that, Shorty.” And he slapped the\\nshoulder of his neighbor. Naturally I took these two for old companions.\\nBut we were all total strangers. They told me of the new gold excitement\\nat Rawhide, and supposed it would bring up the Northern Pacific; and\\nwhen I explained the millions owed to this road's German bondholders,\\nthey were of opinion that a German would strike it richer at Rawhide. We\\nspoke of all sorts of things, and in our silence I gloated on the autumn\\nholiday promised me by Judge Henry. His last letter had said that an\\noutfit would be starting for his ranch from Billings on the seventh, and\\nhe would have a horse for me. This was the fifth. So we six legs in the\\njerky travelled harmoniously on over the rain-gutted road, getting no\\ndeeper knowledge of each other than what our outsides might imply.\\n\\nNot that we concealed anything. The man who had slapped Shorty\\nintroduced himself early. “Scipio le Moyne, from Gallipolice, Ohio,” he\\nsaid. “The eldest of us always gets called Scipio. It's French. But\\nus folks have been white for a hundred years.” He was limber and\\nlight-muscled, and fell skilfully about, evading bruises when the\\njerky reeled or rose on end. He had a strange, long, jocular nose, very\\nwary-looking, and a bleached blue eye. Cattle was his business, as a\\nrule, but of late he had been “looking around some,” and Rawhide seemed\\nmuch on his brain. Shorty struck me as “looking around” also. He was\\nquite short, indeed, and the jerky hurt him almost every time. He was\\nlight-haired and mild. Think of a yellow dog that is lost, and fancies\\neach newcomer in sight is going to turn out his master, and you will\\nhave Shorty.\\n\\nIt was the Northern Pacific that surprised us into intimacy. We were\\nnearing Medora. We had made a last arrangement of our legs. I lay\\nstretched in silence, placid in the knowledge it was soon to end. So\\nI drowsed. I felt something sudden, and, waking, saw Scipio passing\\nthrough the air. As Shorty next shot from the jerky, I beheld smoke and\\nthe locomotive. The Northern Pacific had changed its schedule. A valise\\nis a poor companion for catching a train with. There was rutted sand\\nand lumpy, knee-high grease wood in our short cut. A piece of stray wire\\nsprang from some hole and hung caracoling about my ankle. Tin cans spun\\nfrom my stride. But we made a conspicuous race. Two of us waved hats,\\nand there was no moment that some one of us was not screeching. It meant\\ntwenty-four hours to us.\\n\\nPerhaps we failed to catch the train's attention, though the theory\\nseems monstrous. As it moved off in our faces, smooth and easy and\\ninsulting, Scipio dropped instantly to a walk, and we two others\\noutstripped him and came desperately to the empty track. There went the\\ntrain. Even still its puffs were the separated puffs of starting, that\\nbitten-off, snorty kind, and sweat and our true natures broke freely\\nforth.\\n\\nI kicked my valise, and then sat on it, dumb.\\n\\nShorty yielded himself up aloud. All his humble secrets came out of\\nhim. He walked aimlessly round, lamenting. He had lost his job, and he\\nmentioned the ranch. He had played cards, and he mentioned the man. He\\nhad sold his horse and saddle to catch a friend on this train, and he\\nmentioned what the friend had been going to do for him. He told a string\\nof griefs and names to the air, as if the air knew.\\n\\nMeanwhile Scipio arrived with extreme leisure at the rails. He stuck\\nhis hands into his pockets and his head out at the very small train.\\nHis bleached blue eyes shut to slits as he watched the rear car in its\\nsmoke-blur ooze away westward among the mounded bluffs. “Lucky it's out\\nof range,” I thought. But now Scipio spoke to it.\\n\\n“Why, you seem to think you've left me behind,” he began easily, in\\nfawning tones. “You're too much of a kid to have such thoughts. Age\\nsome.” His next remark grew less wheedling. “I wouldn't be a bit proud\\nto meet yu'. Why, if I was seen travellin' with yu', I'd have to explain\\nit to my friends! Think you've got me left, do yu'? Just because yu'\\nride through this country on a rail, do yu' claim yu' can find your way\\naround? I could take yu' out ten yards in the brush and lose yu' in\\nten seconds, you spangle-roofed hobo! Leave ME behind? you recent\\nblanket-mortgage yearlin'! You plush-lined, nickel-plated, whistlin'\\nwash room, d' yu' figure I can't go east just as soon as west? Or I'll\\nstay right here if it suits me, yu' dude-inhabited hot-box! Why, yu'\\ncoon-bossed face-towel--” But from here he rose in flights of novelty\\nthat appalled and held me spellbound, and which are not for me to say\\nto you. Then he came down easily again, and finished with expressions of\\nsympathy for it because it could never have known a mother.\\n\\n“Do you expaict it could show a male parent offhand?” inquired a slow\\nvoice behind us. I jumped round, and there was the Virginian.\\n\\n“Male parent!” scoffed the prompt Scipio. “Ain't you heard about THEM\\nyet?”\\n\\n“Them? Was there two?”\\n\\n“Two? The blamed thing was sired by a whole doggone Dutch syndicate.”\\n\\n“Why, the piebald son of a gun!” responded the Virginian, sweetly. “I\\ngot them steers through all right,” he added to me. “Sorry to see yu'\\nget so out o' breath afteh the train. Is your valise sufferin' any?”\\n\\n“Who's he?” inquired Scipio, curiously, turning to me.\\n\\nThe Southerner sat with a newspaper on the rear platform of a caboose.\\nThe caboose stood hitched behind a mile or so of freight train, and\\nthe train was headed west. So here was the deputy foreman, his steers\\ndelivered in Chicago, his men (I could hear them) safe in the caboose,\\nhis paper in his lap, and his legs dangling at ease over the railing. He\\nwore the look of a man for whom things are going smooth. And for me the\\nway to Billings was smooth now, also.\\n\\n“Who's he?” Scipio repeated.\\n\\nBut from inside the caboose loud laughter and noise broke on us. Some\\none was reciting “And it's my night to howl.”\\n\\n“We'll all howl when we get to Rawhide,” said some other one; and they\\nhowled now.\\n\\n“These hyeh steam cyars,” said the Virginian to Scipio, “make a man's\\nlanguage mighty nigh as speedy as his travel.” Of Shorty he took no\\nnotice whatever--no more than of the manifestations in the caboose.\\n\\n“So yu' heard me speakin' to the express,” said Scipio. “Well, I guess,\\nsometimes I--See here,” he exclaimed, for the Virginian was gravely\\nconsidering him, “I may have talked some, but I walked a whole lot. You\\ndidn't catch ME squandering no speed. Soon as--”\\n\\n“I noticed,” said the Virginian, “thinkin' came quicker to yu' than\\nrunnin'.”\\n\\nI was glad I was not Shorty, to have my measure taken merely by my\\nway of missing a train. And of course I was sorry that I had kicked my\\nvalise.\\n\\n“Oh, I could tell yu'd been enjoyin' us!” said Scipio. “Observin'\\nsomebody else's scrape always kind o' rests me too. Maybe you're a\\nphilosopher, but maybe there's a pair of us drawd in this deal.”\\n\\nApproval now grew plain upon the face of the Virginian. “By your laigs,”\\n said he, “you are used to the saddle.”\\n\\n“I'd be called used to it, I expect.”\\n\\n“By your hands,” said the Southerner, again, “you ain't roped many\\nsteers lately. Been cookin' or something?”\\n\\n“Say,” retorted Scipio, “tell my future some now. Draw a conclusion from\\nmy mouth.”\\n\\n“I'm right distressed,” answered the gentle Southerner, “we've not a\\ndrop in the outfit.”\\n\\n“Oh, drink with me uptown!” cried Scipio. “I'm pleased to death with\\nyu'.”\\n\\nThe Virginian glanced where the saloons stood just behind the station,\\nand shook his head.\\n\\n“Why, it ain't a bit far to whiskey from here!” urged the other,\\nplaintively. “Step down, now. Scipio le Moyne's my name. Yes, you're\\nlookin' for my brass ear-rings. But there ain't no ear-rings on me. I've\\nbeen white for a hundred years. Step down. I've a forty-dollar thirst.”\\n\\n“You're certainly white,” began the Virginian. “But--”\\n\\nHere the caboose resumed:\\n\\n     “I'm wild, and woolly, and full of peas;\\n      I'm hard to curry above the knees;\\n      I'm a she-wolf from Bitter Creek, and\\n      It's my night to ho-o-wl--”\\n\\nAnd as they howled and stamped, the wheels of the caboose began to turn\\ngently and to murmur.\\n\\nThe Virginian rose suddenly. “Will yu' save that thirst and take a\\nforty-dollar job?”\\n\\n“Missin' trains, profanity, or what?” said Scipio.\\n\\n“I'll tell yu' soon as I'm sure.”\\n\\nAt this Scipio looked hard at the Virginian. “Why, you're talkin'\\nbusiness!” said he, and leaped on the caboose, where I was already. “I\\nWAS thinkin' of Rawhide,” he added, “but I ain't any more.”\\n\\n“Well, good luck!” said Shorty, on the track behind us.\\n\\n“Oh, say!” said Scipio, “he wanted to go on that train, just like me.”\\n\\n“Get on,” called the Virginian. “But as to getting a job, he ain't just\\nlike you.” So Shorty came, like a lost dog when you whistle to him.\\n\\nOur wheels clucked over the main-line switch. A train-hand threw it shut\\nafter us, jumped aboard, and returned forward over the roofs. Inside the\\ncaboose they had reached the third howling of the she-wolf.\\n\\n“Friends of yourn?” said Scipio.\\n\\n“My outfit,” drawled the Virginian.\\n\\n“Do yu' always travel outside?” inquired Scipio.\\n\\n“It's lonesome in there,” returned the deputy foreman. And here one of\\nthem came out, slamming the door.\\n\\n“Hell!” he said, at sight of the distant town. Then, truculently, to the\\nVirginian, “I told you I was going to get a bottle here.”\\n\\n“Have your bottle, then,” said the deputy foreman, and kicked him off\\ninto Dakota. (It was not North Dakota yet; they had not divided it.)\\nThe Virginian had aimed his pistol at about the same time with his\\nboot. Therefore the man sat in Dakota quietly, watching us go away into\\nMontana, and offering no objections. Just before he became too small to\\nmake out, we saw him rise and remove himself back toward the saloons.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXV. THE GAME AND THE NATION--ACT SECOND\\n\\n\\n“That is the only step I have had to take this whole trip,” said the\\nVirginian. He holstered his pistol with a jerk. “I have been fearing\\nhe would force it on me.” And he looked at empty, receding Dakota with\\ndisgust. “So nyeh back home!” he muttered.\\n\\n“Known your friend long?” whispered Scipio to me.\\n\\n“Fairly,” I answered.\\n\\nScipio's bleached eyes brightened with admiration as he considered the\\nSoutherner's back. “Well,” he stated judicially, “start awful early when\\nyu' go to fool with him, or he'll make you feel unpunctual.”\\n\\n“I expaict I've had them almost all of three thousand miles,” said the\\nVirginian, tilting his head toward the noise in the caboose. “And I've\\nstrove to deliver them back as I received them. The whole lot. And I\\nwould have. But he has spoiled my hopes.” The deputy foreman looked\\nagain at Dakota. “It's a disappointment,” he added. “You may know what I\\nmean.”\\n\\nI had known a little, but not to the very deep, of the man's pride and\\npurpose in this trust. Scipio gave him sympathy. “There must be quite a\\nbalance of 'em left with yu' yet,” said Scipio, cheeringly.\\n\\n“I had the boys plumb contented,” pursued the deputy foreman, hurt\\ninto open talk of himself. “Away along as far as Saynt Paul I had them\\nreconciled to my authority. Then this news about gold had to strike us.”\\n\\n“And they're a-dreamin' nuggets and Parisian bowleyvards,” suggested\\nScipio.\\n\\nThe Virginian smiled gratefully at him.\\n\\n“Fortune is shinin' bright and blindin' to their delicate young eyes,”\\n he said, regaining his usual self.\\n\\nWe all listened a moment to the rejoicings within.\\n\\n“Energetic, ain't they?” said the Southerner. “But none of 'em was\\nwhelped savage enough to sing himself bloodthirsty. And though they're\\nstrainin' mighty earnest not to be tame, they're goin' back to Sunk\\nCreek with me accordin' to the Judge's awders. Never a calf of them will\\ndesert to Rawhide, for all their dangerousness; nor I ain't goin' to\\nhave any fuss over it. Only one is left now that don't sing. Maybe I\\nwill have to make some arrangements about him. The man I have parted\\nwith,” he said, with another glance at Dakota, “was our cook, and I will\\nask yu' to replace him, Colonel.”\\n\\nScipio gaped wide. “Colonel! Say!” He stared at the Virginian. “Did I\\nmeet yu' at the palace?”\\n\\n“Not exackly meet,” replied the Southerner. “I was present one mawnin'\\nlas' month when this gentleman awdehed frawgs' laigs.”\\n\\n“Sakes and saints, but that was a mean position!” burst out Scipio. “I\\nhad to tell all comers anything all day. Stand up and jump language hot\\noff my brain at 'em. And the pay don't near compensate for the drain on\\nthe system. I don't care how good a man is, you let him keep a-tappin'\\nhis presence of mind right along, without takin' a lay-off, and you'll\\nhave him sick. Yes, sir. You'll hit his nerves. So I told them they\\ncould hire some fresh man, for I was goin' back to punch cattle or fight\\nIndians, or take a rest somehow, for I didn't propose to get jaded,\\nand me only twenty-five years old. There ain't no regular Colonel\\nCyrus Jones any more, yu' know. He met a Cheyenne telegraph pole in\\nseventy-four, and was buried. But his palace was doin' big business, and\\nhe had been a kind of attraction, and so they always keep a live bear\\noutside, and some poor fello', fixed up like the Colonel used to be,\\ninside. And it's a turruble mean position. Course I'll cook for yu'.\\nYu've a dandy memory for faces!”\\n\\n“I wasn't right convinced till I kicked him off and you gave that shut\\nto your eyes again,” said the Virginian.\\n\\nOnce more the door opened. A man with slim black eyebrows, slim black\\nmustache, and a black shirt tied with a white handkerchief was looking\\nsteadily from one to the other of us.\\n\\n“Good day!” he remarked generally and without enthusiasm; and to the\\nVirginian, “Where's Schoffner?”\\n\\n“I expaict he'll have got his bottle by now, Trampas.”\\n\\nTrampas looked from one to the other of us again. “Didn't he say he was\\ncoming back?”\\n\\n“He reminded me he was going for a bottle, and afteh that he didn't wait\\nto say a thing.”\\n\\nTrampas looked at the platform and the railing and the steps. “He told\\nme he was coming back,” he insisted.\\n\\n“I don't reckon he has come, not without he clumb up ahaid somewhere.\\nAn' I mus' say, when he got off he didn't look like a man does when he\\nhas the intention o' returnin'.”\\n\\nAt this Scipio coughed, and pared his nails attentively. We had already\\nbeen avoiding each other's eye. Shorty did not count. Since he got\\naboard, his meek seat had been the bottom step.\\n\\nThe thoughts of Trampas seemed to be in difficulty. “How long's this\\ntrain been started?” he demanded.\\n\\n“This hyeh train?” The Virginian consulted his watch. “Why, it's been\\nfanning it a right smart little while,” said he, laying no stress upon\\nhis indolent syllables.\\n\\n“Huh!” went Trampas. He gave the rest of us a final unlovely scrutiny.\\n“It seems to have become a passenger train,” he said. And he returned\\nabruptly inside the caboose.\\n\\n“Is he the member who don't sing?” asked Scipio.\\n\\n“That's the specimen,” replied the Southerner.\\n\\n“He don't seem musical in the face,” said Scipio.\\n\\n“Pshaw!” returned the Virginian. “Why, you surely ain't the man to mind\\nugly mugs when they're hollow!”\\n\\nThe noise inside had dropped quickly to stillness. You could scarcely\\ncatch the sound of talk. Our caboose was clicking comfortably westward,\\nrail after rail, mile upon mile, while night was beginning to rise from\\nearth into the clouded sky.\\n\\n“I wonder if they have sent a search party forward to hunt Schoffner?”\\n said the Virginian. “I think I'll maybe join their meeting.” He opened\\nthe door upon them. “Kind o' dark hyeh, ain't it?” said he. And lighting\\nthe lantern, he shut us out.\\n\\n“What do yu' think?” said Scipio to me. “Will he take them to Sunk\\nCreek?”\\n\\n“He evidently thinks he will,” said I. “He says he will, and he has the\\ncourage of his convictions.”\\n\\n“That ain't near enough courage to have!” Scipio exclaimed.\\n“There's times in life when a man has got to have courage WITHOUT\\nconvictions--WITHOUT them--or he is no good. Now your friend is that\\ndeep constitooted that you don't know and I don't know what he's\\nthinkin' about all this.”\\n\\n“If there's to be any gun-play,” put in the excellent Shorty, “I'll\\nstand in with him.”\\n\\n“Ah, go to bed with your gun-play!” retorted Scipio, entirely\\ngood-humored. “Is the Judge paying for a carload of dead punchers to\\ngather his beef for him? And this ain't a proposition worth a man's\\ngettin' hurt for himself, anyway.”\\n\\n“That's so,” Shorty assented.\\n\\n“No,” speculated Scipio, as the night drew deeper round us and the\\ncaboose click-clucked and click-clucked over the rail joints; “he's\\nwaitin' for somebody else to open this pot. I'll bet he don't know but\\none thing now, and that's that nobody else shall know he don't know\\nanything.”\\n\\nScipio had delivered himself. He lighted a cigarette, and no more wisdom\\ncame from him. The night was established. The rolling bad-lands sank\\naway in it. A train-hand had arrived over the roof, and hanging the red\\nlights out behind, left us again without remark or symptom of curiosity.\\nThe train-hands seemed interested in their own society and lived in\\ntheir own caboose. A chill wind with wet in it came blowing from the\\ninvisible draws, and brought the feel of the distant mountains.\\n\\n“That's Montana!” said Scipio, snuffing. “I am glad to have it inside my\\nlungs again.”\\n\\n“Ain't yu' getting cool out there?” said the Virginian's voice. “Plenty\\nroom inside.”\\n\\nPerhaps he had expected us to follow him; or perhaps he had meant us\\nto delay long enough not to seem like a reenforcement. “These gentlemen\\nmissed the express at Medora,” he observed to his men, simply.\\n\\nWhat they took us for upon our entrance I cannot say, or what they\\nbelieved. The atmosphere of the caboose was charged with voiceless\\ncurrents of thought. By way of a friendly beginning to the three hundred\\nmiles of caboose we were now to share so intimately, I recalled myself\\nto them. I trusted no more of the Christian Endeavor had delayed them.\\n“I am so lucky to have caught you again,” I finished. “I was afraid my\\nlast chance of reaching the Judge's had gone.”\\n\\nThus I said a number of things designed to be agreeable, but they met my\\nsmall talk with the smallest talk you can have. “Yes,” for instance, and\\n“Pretty well, I guess,” and grave strikings of matches and thoughtful\\nlooks at the floor. I suppose we had made twenty miles to the\\nimperturbable clicking of the caboose when one at length asked his\\nneighbor had he ever seen New York.\\n\\n“No,” said the other. “Flooded with dudes, ain't it?”\\n\\n“Swimmin',” said the first.\\n\\n“Leakin', too,” said a third.\\n\\n“Well, my gracious!” said a fourth, and beat his knee in private\\ndelight. None of them ever looked at me. For some reason I felt\\nexceedingly ill at ease.\\n\\n“Good clothes in New York,” said the third.\\n\\n“Rich food,” said the first.\\n\\n“Fresh eggs, too,” said the third.\\n\\n“Well, my gracious!” said the fourth, beating his knee.\\n\\n“Why, yes,” observed the Virginian, unexpectedly; “they tell me that\\naiggs there ain't liable to be so rotten as yu'll strike 'em in this\\ncountry.”\\n\\nNone of them had a reply for this, and New York was abandoned. For some\\nreason I felt much better.\\n\\nIt was a new line they adopted next, led off by Trampas.\\n\\n“Going to the excitement?” he inquired, selecting Shorty.\\n\\n“Excitement?” said Shorty, looking up.\\n\\n“Going to Rawhide?” Trampas repeated. And all watched Shorty.\\n\\n“Why, I'm all adrift missin' that express,” said Shorty.\\n\\n“Maybe I can give you employment,” suggested the Virginian. “I am taking\\nan outfit across the basin.”\\n\\n“You'll find most folks going to Rawhide, if you're looking for\\ncompany,” pursued Trampas, fishing for a recruit.\\n\\n“How about Rawhide, anyway?” said Scipio, skillfully deflecting this\\nmissionary work. “Are they taking much mineral out? Have yu' seen any of\\nthe rock?”\\n\\n“Rock?” broke in the enthusiast who had beaten his knee. “There!” And he\\nbrought some from his pocket.\\n\\n“You're always showing your rock,” said Trampas, sulkily; for Scipio now\\nheld the conversation, and Shorty returned safely to his dozing.\\n\\n“H'm!” went Scipio at the rock. He turned it back and forth in his hand,\\nlooking it over; he chucked and caught it slightingly in the air, and\\nhanded it back. “Porphyry, I see.” That was his only word about it. He\\nsaid it cheerily. He left no room for discussion. You could not damn\\na thing worse. “Ever been in Santa Rita?” pursued Scipio, while the\\nenthusiast slowly pushed his rock back into his pocket. “That's down in\\nNew Mexico. Ever been to Globe, Arizona?” And Scipio talked away about\\nthe mines he had known. There was no getting at Shorty any more that\\nevening. Trampas was foiled of his fish, or of learning how the fish's\\nheart lay. And by morning Shorty had been carefully instructed to change\\nhis mind about once an hour. This is apt to discourage all but very\\nsuperior missionaries. And I too escaped for the rest of this night. At\\nGlendive we had a dim supper, and I bought some blankets; and after that\\nit was late, and sleep occupied the attention of us all.\\n\\nWe lay along the shelves of the caboose, a peaceful sight I should\\nthink, in that smoothly trundling cradle. I slept almost immediately, so\\ntired that not even our stops or anything else waked me, save once, when\\nthe air I was breathing grew suddenly pure, and I roused. Sitting in\\nthe door was the lonely figure of the Virginian. He leaned in silent\\ncontemplation of the occasional moon, and beneath it the Yellowstone's\\nswift ripples. On the caboose shelves the others slept sound and still,\\neach stretched or coiled as he had first put himself. They were not\\nuntrustworthy to look at, it seemed to me--except Trampas. You would\\nhave said the rest of that young humanity was average rough male blood,\\nmerely needing to be told the proper things at the right time; and one\\nbig bunchy stocking of the enthusiast stuck out of his blanket, solemn\\nand innocent, and I laughed at it. There was a light sound by the door,\\nand I found the Virginian's eye on me. Finding who it was, he nodded\\nand motioned with his hand to go to sleep. And this I did with him in\\nmy sight, still leaning in the open door, through which came the\\ninterrupted moon and the swimming reaches of the Yellowstone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXVI. THE GAME AND THE NATION--LAST ACT\\n\\n\\nIt has happened to you, has it not, to wake in the morning and wonder\\nfor a while where on earth you are? Thus I came half to life in the\\ncaboose, hearing voices, but not the actual words at first.\\n\\nBut presently, “Hathaway!” said some one more clearly. “Portland 1291!”\\n\\nThis made no special stir in my intelligence, and I drowsed off again\\nto the pleasant rhythm of the wheels. The little shock of stopping next\\nbrought me to, somewhat, with the voices still round me; and when we\\nwere again in motion, I heard: “Rosebud! Portland 1279!” These figures\\njarred me awake, and I said, “It was 1291 before,” and sat up in my\\nblankets.\\n\\nThe greeting they vouchsafed and the sight of them clustering\\nexpressionless in the caboose brought last evening's uncomfortable\\nmemory back to me. Our next stop revealed how things were going to-day.\\n\\n“Forsythe,” one of them read on the station. “Portland 1266.”\\n\\nThey were counting the lessening distance westward. This was the\\nundercurrent of war. It broke on me as I procured fresh water at\\nForsythe and made some toilet in their stolid presence. We were drawing\\nnearer the Rawhide station--the point, I mean, where you left the\\nrailway for the new mines. Now Rawhide station lay this side of\\nBillings. The broad path of desertion would open ready for their feet\\nwhen the narrow path to duty and Sunk Creek was still some fifty miles\\nmore to wait. Here was Trampas's great strength; he need make no move\\nmeanwhile, but lie low for the immediate temptation to front and waylay\\nthem and win his battle over the deputy foreman. But the Virginian\\nseemed to find nothing save enjoyment in this sunny September morning,\\nand ate his breakfast at Forsythe serenely.\\n\\nThat meal done and that station gone, our caboose took up again its easy\\ntrundle by the banks of the Yellowstone. The mutineers sat for a while\\ndigesting in idleness.\\n\\n“What's your scar?” inquired one at length inspecting casually the neck\\nof his neighbor.\\n\\n“Foolishness,” the other answered.\\n\\n“Yourn?”\\n\\n“Mine.”\\n\\n“Well, I don't know but I prefer to have myself to thank for a thing,”\\n said the first.\\n\\n“I was displaying myself,” continued the second. “One day last summer it\\nwas. We come on a big snake by Torrey Creek corral. The boys got betting\\npretty lively that I dassent make my word good as to dealing with him,\\nso I loped my cayuse full tilt by Mr. Snake, and swung down and catched\\nhim up by the tail from the ground, and cracked him same as a whip, and\\nsnapped his head off. You've saw it done?” he said to the audience.\\n\\nThe audience nodded wearily.\\n\\n“But the loose head flew agin me, and the fangs caught. I was pretty\\nsick for a while.”\\n\\n“It don't pay to be clumsy,” said the first man. “If you'd snapped the\\nsnake away from yu' instead of toward yu', its head would have whirled\\noff into the brush, same as they do with me.”\\n\\n“How like a knife-cut your scar looks!” said I.\\n\\n“Don't it?” said the snake-snapper. “There's many that gets fooled by\\nit.”\\n\\n“An antelope knows a snake is his enemy,” said another to me. “Ever seen\\na buck circling round and round a rattler?”\\n\\n“I have always wanted to see that,” said I, heartily. For this I knew to\\nbe a respectable piece of truth.\\n\\n“It's worth seeing,” the man went on. “After the buck gets close in, he\\ngives an almighty jump up in the air, and down comes his four hoofs in\\na bunch right on top of Mr. Snake. Cuts him all to hash. Now you tell me\\nhow the buck knows that.”\\n\\nOf course I could not tell him. And again we sat in silence for a\\nwhile--friendlier silence, I thought.\\n\\n“A skunk'll kill yu' worse than a snake bite,” said another, presently.\\n“No, I don't mean that way,” he added. For I had smiled. “There is a\\nbrown skunk down in Arkansaw. Kind of prairie-dog brown. Littler than\\nour variety, he is. And he is mad the whole year round, same as a dog\\ngets. Only the dog has a spell and dies but this here Arkansaw skunk\\nis mad right along, and it don't seem to interfere with his business in\\nother respects. Well, suppose you're camping out, and suppose it's a hot\\nnight, or you're in a hurry, and you've made camp late, or anyway you\\nhaven't got inside any tent, but you have just bedded down in the open.\\nSkunk comes travelling along and walks on your blankets. You're warm. He\\nlikes that, same as a cat does. And he tramps with pleasure and comfort,\\nsame as a cat. And you move. You get bit, that's all. And you die of\\nhydrophobia. Ask anybody.”\\n\\n“Most extraordinary!” said I. “But did you ever see a person die from\\nthis?”\\n\\n“No, sir. Never happened to. My cousin at Bald Knob did.”\\n\\n“Died?”\\n\\n“No, sir. Saw a man.”\\n\\n“But how do you know they're not sick skunks?”\\n\\n“No, sir! They're well skunks. Well as anything. You'll not meet skunks\\nin any state of the Union more robust than them in Arkansaw. And thick.”\\n\\n“That's awful true,” sighed another. “I have buried hundreds of dollars'\\nworth of clothes in Arkansaw.”\\n\\n“Why didn't yu' travel in a sponge bag?” inquired Scipio. And this\\nbrought a slight silence.\\n\\n“Speakin' of bites,” spoke up a new man, “how's that?” He held up his\\nthumb.\\n\\n“My!” breathed Scipio. “Must have been a lion.”\\n\\nThe man wore a wounded look. “I was huntin' owl eggs for a botanist from\\nBoston,” he explained to me.\\n\\n“Chiropodist, weren't he?” said Scipio. “Or maybe a sonnabulator?”\\n\\n“No, honest,” protested the man with the thumb; so that I was sorry for\\nhim, and begged him to go on.\\n\\n“I'll listen to you,” I assured him. And I wondered why this politeness\\nof mine should throw one or two of them into stifled mirth. Scipio, on\\nthe other hand, gave me a disgusted look and sat back sullenly for a\\nmoment, and then took himself out on the platform, where the Virginian\\nwas lounging.\\n\\n“The young feller wore knee-pants and ever so thick spectacles with a\\nhalf-moon cut in 'em,” resumed the narrator, “and he carried a tin box\\nstrung to a strap I took for his lunch till it flew open on him and a\\nhorn toad hustled out. Then I was sure he was a botanist--or whatever\\nyu' say they're called. Well, he would have owl eggs--them little\\nprairie-owl that some claim can turn their head clean around and\\nkeep a-watchin' yu', only that's nonsense. We was ridin' through that\\nprairie-dog town, used to be on the flat just after yu' crossed the\\nsouth fork of Powder River on the Buffalo trail, and I said I'd dig an\\nowl nest out for him if he was willing to camp till I'd dug it. I wanted\\nto know about them owls some myself--if they did live with the dogs and\\nsnakes, yu' know,” he broke off, appealing to me.\\n\\n“Oh, yes,” I told him eagerly.\\n\\n“So while the botanist went glarin' around the town with his glasses to\\nsee if he could spot a prairie-dog and an owl usin' the same hole, I was\\ndiggin' in a hole I'd seen an owl run down. And that's what I got.” He\\nheld up his thumb again.\\n\\n“The snake!” I exclaimed.\\n\\n“Yes, sir. Mr. Rattler was keepin' house that day. Took me right there.\\nI hauled him out of the hole hangin' to me. Eight rattles.”\\n\\n“Eight!” said I. “A big one.”\\n\\n“Yes, sir. Thought I was dead. But the woman--”\\n\\n“The woman?” said I.\\n\\n“Yes, woman. Didn't I tell yu' the botanist had his wife along? Well, he\\ndid. And she acted better than the man, for he was losin' his head,\\nand shoutin' he had no whiskey, and he didn't guess his knife was sharp\\nenough to amputate my thumb, and none of us chewed, and the doctor\\nwas twenty miles away, and if he had only remembered to bring his\\nammonia--well, he was screeching out 'most everything he knew in the\\nworld, and without arranging it any, neither. But she just clawed his\\npocket and burrowed and kep' yelling, 'Give him the stone, Augustus!'\\nAnd she whipped out one of them Injun medicine-stones,--first one I ever\\nseen,--and she clapped it on to my thumb, and it started in right away.”\\n\\n“What did it do?” said I.\\n\\n“Sucked. Like blotting-paper does. Soft and funny it was, and gray. They\\nget 'em from elks' stomachs, yu' know. And when it had sucked the poison\\nout of the wound, off it falls of my thumb by itself! And I thanked the\\nwoman for saving my life that capable and keeping her head that cool.\\nI never knowed how excited she had been till afterward. She was awful\\nshocked.”\\n\\n“I suppose she started to talk when the danger was over,” said I, with\\ndeep silence around me.\\n\\n“No; she didn't say nothing to me. But when her next child was born, it\\nhad eight rattles.”\\n\\nDin now rose wild in the caboose. They rocked together. The enthusiast\\nbeat his knee tumultuously. And I joined them. Who could help it? It\\nhad been so well conducted from the imperceptible beginning. Fact and\\nfalsehood blended with such perfect art. And this last, an effect so\\nnew made with such world-old material! I cared nothing that I was\\nthe victim, and I joined them; but ceased, feeling suddenly somehow\\nestranged or chilled. It was in their laughter. The loudness was too\\nloud. And I caught the eyes of Trampas fixed upon the Virginian with\\nexultant malevolence. Scipio's disgusted glance was upon me from the\\ndoor.\\n\\nDazed by these signs, I went out on the platform to get away from the\\nnoise. There the Virginian said to me: “Cheer up! You'll not be so easy\\nfor 'em that-a-way next season.”\\n\\nHe said no more; and with his legs dangled over the railing, appeared to\\nresume his newspaper.\\n\\n“What's the matter?” said I to Scipio.\\n\\n“Oh, I don't mind if he don't,” Scipio answered. “Couldn't yu' see? I\\ntried to head 'em off from yu' all I knew, but yu' just ran in among 'em\\nyourself. Couldn't yu' see? Kep' hinderin' and spoilin' me with askin'\\nthose urgent questions of yourn--why, I had to let yu' go your way! Why,\\nthat wasn't the ordinary play with the ordinary tenderfoot they treated\\nyou to! You ain't a common tenderfoot this trip. You're the foreman's\\nfriend. They've hit him through you. That's the way they count it. It's\\nmade them encouraged. Can't yu' see?”\\n\\nScipio stated it plainly. And as we ran by the next station, “Howard!”\\n they harshly yelled. “Portland 1256!”\\n\\nWe had been passing gangs of workmen on the track. And at that last yell\\nthe Virginian rose. “I reckon I'll join the meeting again,” he said.\\n“This filling and repairing looks like the washout might have been\\ntrue.”\\n\\n“Washout?” said Scipio.\\n\\n“Big Horn bridge, they say--four days ago.”\\n\\n“Then I wish it came this side Rawhide station.”\\n\\n“Do yu'?” drawled the Virginian. And smiling at Scipio, he lounged in\\nthrough the open door.\\n\\n“He beats me,” said Scipio, shaking his head. “His trail is turruble\\nhard to anticipate.”\\n\\nWe listened.\\n\\n“Work bein' done on the road, I see,” the Virginian was saying, very\\nfriendly and conversational.\\n\\n“We see it too,” said the voice of Trampas.\\n\\n“Seem to be easin' their grades some.”\\n\\n“Roads do.”\\n\\n“Cheaper to build 'em the way they want 'em at the start, a man would\\nthink,” suggested the Virginian, most friendly. “There go some more\\nI-talians.”\\n\\n“They're Chinese,” said Trampas.\\n\\n“That's so,” acknowledged the Virginian, with a laugh.\\n\\n“What's he monkeyin' at now?” muttered Scipio.\\n\\n“Without cheap foreigners they couldn't afford all this hyeh new\\ngradin',” the Southerner continued.\\n\\n“Grading! Can't you tell when a flood's been eating the banks?”\\n\\n“Why, yes,” said the Virginian, sweet as honey. “But 'ain't yu' heard\\nof the improvements west of Big Timber, all the way to Missoula, this\\nseason? I'm talkin' about them.”\\n\\n“Oh! Talking about them. Yes, I've heard.”\\n\\n“Good money-savin' scheme, ain't it?” said the Virginian. “Lettin' a\\nfreight run down one hill an' up the next as far as she'll go without\\nsteam, an' shavin' the hill down to that point.” Now this was an honest\\nengineering fact. “Better'n settin' dudes squintin' through telescopes\\nand cypherin' over one per cent reductions,” the Southerner commented.\\n\\n“It's common sense,” assented Trampas. “Have you heard the new scheme\\nabout the water-tanks?”\\n\\n“I ain't right certain,” said the Southerner.\\n\\n“I must watch this,” said Scipio, “or I shall bust.” He went in, and so\\ndid I.\\n\\nThey were all sitting over this discussion of the Northern Pacific's\\nrecent policy as to betterments, as though they were the board of\\ndirectors. Pins could have dropped. Only nobody would have cared to hear\\na pin.\\n\\n“They used to put all their tanks at the bottom of their grades,” said\\nTrampas.\\n\\n“Why, yu' get the water easier at the bottom.”\\n\\n“You can pump it to the top, though,” said Trampas, growing superior.\\n“And it's cheaper.”\\n\\n“That gets me,” said the Virginian, interested.\\n\\n“Trains after watering can start down hill now and get the benefit of\\nthe gravity. It'll cut down operating expenses a heap.”\\n\\n“That's cert'nly common sense!” exclaimed the Virginian, absorbed. “But\\nain't it kind o' tardy?”\\n\\n“Live and learn. So they gained speed, too. High speed on half the coal\\nthis season, until the accident.”\\n\\n“Accident!” said the Virginian, instantly.\\n\\n“Yellowstone Limited. Man fired at engine driver. Train was flying past\\nthat quick the bullet broke every window and killed a passenger on the\\nback platform. You've been running too much with aristocrats,” finished\\nTrampas, and turned on his heel.\\n\\n“Haw, hew!” began the enthusiast, but his neighbor gripped him to\\nsilence. This was a triumph too serious for noise. Not a mutineer moved;\\nand I felt cold.\\n\\n“Trampas,” said the Virginian, “I thought yu'd be afeared to try it on\\nme.”\\n\\nTrampas whirled round. His hand was at his belt. “Afraid!” he sneered.\\n\\n“Shorty!” said Scipio, sternly, and leaping upon that youth, took his\\nhalf-drawn pistol from him.\\n\\n“I'm obliged to yu',” said the Virginian to Scipio. Trampas's hand left\\nhis belt. He threw a slight, easy look at his men, and keeping his back\\nto the Virginian, walked out on the platform and sat on the chair where\\nthe Virginian had sat so much.\\n\\n“Don't you comprehend,” said the Virginian to Shorty, amiably, “that\\nthis hyeh question has been discussed peaceable by civilized citizens?\\nNow you sit down and be good, and Mr. Le Moyne will return your gun when\\nwe're across that broken bridge, if they have got it fixed for heavy\\ntrains yet.”\\n\\n“This train will be lighter when it gets to that bridge,” spoke Trampas,\\nout on his chair.\\n\\n“Why, that's true, too!” said the Virginian. “Maybe none of us are\\ncrossin' that Big Horn bridge now, except me. Funny if yu' should end by\\npersuadin' me to quit and go to Rawhide myself! But I reckon I'll not. I\\nreckon I'll worry along to Sunk Creek, somehow.”\\n\\n“Don't forget I'm cookin' for yu',” said Scipio, gruffy.\\n\\n“I'm obliged to yu',” said the Southerner.\\n\\n“You were speaking of a job for me,” said Shorty.\\n\\n“I'm right obliged. But yu' see--I ain't exackly foreman the way this\\ncomes out, and my promises might not bind Judge Henry to pay salaries.”\\n\\nA push came through the train from forward. We were slowing for the\\nRawhide station, and all began to be busy and to talk. “Going up to the\\nmines to-day?” “Oh, let's grub first.” “Guess it's too late, anyway.”\\n And so forth; while they rolled and roped their bedding, and put on\\ntheir coats with a good deal of elbow motion, and otherwise showed\\noff. It was wasted. The Virginian did not know what was going on in the\\ncaboose. He was leaning and looking out ahead, and Scipio's puzzled\\neye never left him. And as we halted for the water-tank, the Southerner\\nexclaimed, “They 'ain't got away yet!” as if it were good news to him.\\n\\nHe meant the delayed trains. Four stalled expresses were in front of us,\\nbesides several freights. And two hours more at least before the bridge\\nwould be ready.\\n\\nTravellers stood and sat about forlorn, near the cars, out in the\\nsage-brush, anywhere. People in hats and spurs watched them, and Indian\\nchiefs offered them painted bows and arrows and shiny horns.\\n\\n“I reckon them passengers would prefer a laig o' mutton,” said the\\nVirginian to a man loafing near the caboose.\\n\\n“Bet your life!” said the man. “First lot has been stuck here four\\ndays.”\\n\\n“Plumb starved, ain't they?” inquired the Virginian.\\n\\n“Bet your life! They've eat up their dining cars and they've eat up this\\ntown.”\\n\\n“Well,” said the Virginian, looking at the town, “I expaict the\\ndining-cyars contained more nourishment.”\\n\\n“Say, you're about right there!” said the man. He walked beside the\\ncaboose as we puffed slowly forward from the water-tank to our siding.\\n“Fine business here if we'd only been ready,” he continued. “And the\\nCrow agent has let his Indians come over from the reservation. There has\\nbeen a little beef brought in, and game, and fish. And big money in it,\\nbet your life! Them Eastern passengers has just been robbed. I wisht I\\nhad somethin' to sell!”\\n\\n“Anything starting for Rawhide this afternoon?” said Trampas, out of the\\ncaboose door.\\n\\n“Not until morning,” said the man. “You going to the mines?” he resumed\\nto the Virginian.\\n\\n“Why,” answered the Southerner, slowly and casually, and addressing\\nhimself strictly to the man, while Trampas, on his side, paid obvious\\ninattention, “this hyeh delay, yu' see, may unsettle our plans some.\\nBut it'll be one of two ways,--we're all goin' to Rawhide, or we're all\\ngoin' to Billings. We're all one party, yu' see.”\\n\\nTrampas laughed audibly inside the door as he rejoined his men. “Let him\\nkeep up appearances,” I heard him tell them. “It don't hurt us what he\\nsays to strangers.”\\n\\n“But I'm goin' to eat hearty either way,” continued the Virginian. “And\\nI ain' goin' to be robbed. I've been kind o' promisin' myself a treat if\\nwe stopped hyeh.”\\n\\n“Town's eat clean out,” said the man.\\n\\n“So yu' tell me. But all you folks has forgot one source of revenue that\\nyu' have right close by, mighty handy. If you have got a gunny sack,\\nI'll show you how to make some money.”\\n\\n“Bet your life!” said the man.\\n\\n“Mr. Le Moyne,” said the Virginian, “the outfit's cookin' stuff is\\naboard, and if you'll get the fire ready, we'll try how frawgs' laigs go\\nfried.” He walked off at once, the man following like a dog. Inside the\\ncaboose rose a gust of laughter.\\n\\n“Frogs!” muttered Scipio. And then turning a blank face to me, “Frogs?”\\n\\n“Colonel Cyrus Jones had them on his bill of fare,” I said. “'FROGS'\\nLEGS A LA DELMONICO.'”\\n\\n“Shoo! I didn't get up that thing. They had it when I came. Never looked\\nat it. Frogs?” He went down the steps very slowly, with a long frown.\\nReaching the ground, he shook his head. “That man's trail is surely\\nhard to anticipate,” he said. “But I must hurry up that fire. For his\\nappearance has given me encouragement,” Scipio concluded, and became\\nbrisk. Shorty helped him, and I brought wood. Trampas and the other\\npeople strolled off to the station, a compact band.\\n\\nOur little fire was built beside the caboose, so the cooking things\\nmight be easily reached and put back. You would scarcely think such\\noperations held any interest, even for the hungry, when there seemed\\nto be nothing to cook. A few sticks blazing tamely in the dust, a\\nfrying-pan, half a tin bucket of lard, some water, and barren plates and\\nknives and forks, and three silent men attending to them--that was all.\\nBut the travellers came to see. These waifs drew near us, and stood, a\\nsad, lone, shifting fringe of audience; four to begin with; and then two\\nwandered away; and presently one of these came back, finding it worse\\nelsewhere. “Supper, boys?” said he. “Breakfast,” said Scipio, crossly.\\nAnd no more of them addressed us. I heard them joylessly mention Wall\\nStreet to each other, and Saratoga; I even heard the name Bryn Mawr,\\nwhich is near Philadelphia. But these fragments of home dropped in the\\nwilderness here in Montana beside a freight caboose were of no interest\\nto me now.\\n\\n“Looks like frogs down there, too,” said Scipio. “See them marshy sloos\\nfull of weeds?” We took a little turn and had a sight of the Virginian\\nquite active among the ponds. “Hush! I'm getting some thoughts,”\\n continued Scipio. “He wasn't sorry enough. Don't interrupt me.”\\n\\n“I'm not,” said I.\\n\\n“No. But I'd 'most caught a-hold.” And Scipio muttered to himself again,\\n“He wasn't sorry enough.” Presently he swore loud and brilliantly.\\n“Tell yu'!” he cried. “What did he say to Trampas after that play they\\nexchanged over railroad improvements and Trampas put the josh on him?\\nDidn't he say, 'Trampas, I thought you'd be afraid to do it?' Well, sir,\\nTrampas had better have been afraid. And that's what he meant. There's\\nwhere he was bringin' it to. Trampas made an awful bad play then. You\\nwait. Glory, but he's a knowin' man! Course he wasn't sorry. I guess he\\nhad the hardest kind of work to look as sorry as he did. You wait.”\\n\\n“Wait? What for? Go on, man! What for?”\\n\\n“I don't know! I don't know! Whatever hand he's been holdin' up, this is\\nthe show-down. He's played for a show-down here before the caboose gets\\noff the bridge. Come back to the fire, or Shorty'll be leavin' it\\ngo out. Grow happy some, Shorty!” he cried on arriving, and his hand\\ncracked on Shorty's shoulder. “Supper's in sight, Shorty. Food for\\nreflection.”\\n\\n“None for the stomach?” asked the passenger who had spoken once before.\\n\\n“We're figuring on that too,” said Scipio. His crossness had melted\\nentirely away.\\n\\n“Why, they're cow-boys!” exclaimed another passenger; and he moved\\nnearer.\\n\\nFrom the station Trampas now came back, his herd following him less\\ncompactly. They had found famine, and no hope of supplies until the\\nnext train from the East. This was no fault of Trampas's; but they were\\nfollowing him less compactly. They carried one piece of cheese, the\\nsize of a fist, the weight of a brick, the hue of a corpse. And the\\npassengers, seeing it, exclaimed, “There's Old Faithful again!” and took\\noff their hats.\\n\\n“You gentlemen met that cheese before, then?” said Scipio, delighted.\\n\\n“It's been offered me three times a day for four days,” said the\\npassenger. “Did he want a dollar or a dollar and a half?”\\n\\n“Two dollars!” blurted out the enthusiast. And all of us save Trampas\\nfell into fits of imbecile laughter.\\n\\n“Here comes our grub, anyway,” said Scipio, looking off toward the\\nmarshes. And his hilarity sobered away in a moment.\\n\\n“Well, the train will be in soon,” stated Trampas. “I guess we'll get a\\ndecent supper without frogs.”\\n\\nAll interest settled now upon the Virginian. He was coming with his man\\nand his gunny sack, and the gunny sack hung from his shoulder heavily,\\nas a full sack should. He took no notice of the gathering, but sat down\\nand partly emptied the sack. “There,” said he, very businesslike, to his\\nassistant, “that's all we'll want. I think you'll find a ready market\\nfor the balance.”\\n\\n“Well, my gracious!” said the enthusiast. “What fool eats a frog?”\\n\\n“Oh, I'm fool enough for a tadpole!” cried the passenger. And they began\\nto take out their pocket-books.\\n\\n“You can cook yours right hyeh, gentlemen,” said the Virginian, with\\nhis slow Southern courtesy. “The dining-cyars don't look like they were\\nfired up.”\\n\\n“How much will you sell a couple for?” inquired the enthusiast.\\n\\nThe Virginian looked at him with friendly surprise. “Why, help yourself!\\nWe're all together yet awhile. Help yourselves,” he repeated, to Trampas\\nand his followers. These hung back a moment, then, with a slinking\\nmotion, set the cheese upon the earth and came forward nearer the fire\\nto receive some supper.\\n\\n“It won't scarcely be Delmonico style,” said the Virginian to the\\npassengers, “nor yet Saynt Augustine.” He meant the great Augustin, the\\ntraditional chef of Philadelphia, whose history I had sketched for him\\nat Colonel Cyrus Jones's eating palace.\\n\\nScipio now officiated. His frying-pan was busy, and prosperous odors\\nrose from it.\\n\\n“Run for a bucket of fresh water, Shorty,” the Virginian continued,\\nbeginning his meal. “Colonel, yu' cook pretty near good. If yu' had sold\\n'em as advertised, yu'd have cert'nly made a name.”\\n\\nSeveral were now eating with satisfaction, but not Scipio. It was all\\nthat he could do to cook straight. The whole man seemed to glisten.\\nHis eye was shut to a slit once more, while the innocent passengers\\nthankfully swallowed.\\n\\n“Now, you see, you have made some money,” began the Virginian to the\\nnative who had helped him get the frogs.\\n\\n“Bet your life!” exclaimed the man. “Divvy, won't you?” And he held out\\nhalf his gains.\\n\\n“Keep 'em,” returned the Southerner. “I reckon we're square. But I\\nexpaict they'll not equal Delmonico's, seh?” he said to a passenger.\\n\\n“Don't trust the judgment of a man as hungry as I am!” exclaimed the\\ntraveller, with a laugh. And he turned to his fellow-travellers. “Did\\nyou ever enjoy supper at Delmonico's more than this?”\\n\\n“Never!” they sighed.\\n\\n“Why, look here,” said the traveller, “what fools the people of this\\ntown are! Here we've been all these starving days, and you come and get\\nahead of them!”\\n\\n“That's right easy explained,” said the Virginian. “I've been where\\nthere was big money in frawgs, and they 'ain't been. They're all cattle\\nhyeh. Talk cattle, think cattle, and they're bankrupt in consequence.\\nFallen through. Ain't that so?” he inquired of the native.\\n\\n“That's about the way,” said the man.\\n\\n“It's mighty hard to do what your neighbors ain't doin',” pursued the\\nVirginian. “Montana is all cattle, an' these folks must be cattle,\\nan' never notice the country right hyeh is too small for a range, an'\\nswampy, anyway, an' just waitin' to be a frawg ranch.”\\n\\nAt this, all wore a face of careful reserve.\\n\\n“I'm not claimin' to be smarter than you folks hyeh,” said the\\nVirginian, deprecatingly, to his assistant. “But travellin' learns a\\nman many customs. You wouldn't do the business they done at Tulare,\\nCalifornia, north side o' the lake. They cert'nly utilized them hopeless\\nswamps splendid. Of course they put up big capital and went into it\\nscientific, gettin' advice from the government Fish Commission, an' such\\nlike knowledge. Yu' see, they had big markets for their frawgs,--San\\nFrancisco, Los Angeles, and clear to New York afteh the Southern Pacific\\nwas through. But up hyeh yu' could sell to passengers every day like yu'\\ndone this one day. They would get to know yu' along the line. Competing\\nswamps are scarce. The dining-cyars would take your frawgs, and yu'\\nwould have the Yellowstone Park for four months in the year. Them hotels\\nare anxious to please, an' they would buy off yu' what their Eastern\\npatrons esteem as fine-eatin'. And you folks would be sellin' something\\ninstead o' nothin'.”\\n\\n“That's a practical idea,” said a traveller. “And little cost.”\\n\\n“And little cost,” said the Virginian.\\n\\n“Would Eastern people eat frogs?” inquired the man.\\n\\n“Look at us!” said the traveller.\\n\\n“Delmonico doesn't give yu' such a treat!” said the Virginian.\\n\\n“Not exactly!” the traveller exclaimed.\\n\\n“How much would be paid for frogs?” said Trampas to him. And I saw\\nScipio bend closer to his cooking.\\n\\n“Oh, I don't know,” said the traveller. “We've paid pretty well, you\\nsee.”\\n\\n“You're late for Tulare, Trampas,” said the Virginian.\\n\\n“I was not thinking of Tulare,” Trampas retorted. Scipio's nose was in\\nthe frying-pan.\\n\\n“Mos' comical spot you ever struck!” said the Virginian, looking round\\nupon the whole company. He allowed himself a broad smile of retrospect.\\n“To hear 'em talk frawgs at Tulare! Same as other folks talks hawsses or\\nsteers or whatever they're raising to sell. Yu'd fall into it yourselves\\nif yu' started the business. Anything a man's bread and butter depends\\non, he's going to be earnest about. Don't care if it is a frawg.”\\n\\n“That's so,” said the native. “And it paid good?”\\n\\n“The only money in the county was right there,” answered the Virginian.\\n“It was a dead county, and only frawgs was movin'. But that business was\\na-fannin' to beat four of a kind. It made yu' feel strange at first, as\\nI said. For all the men had been cattle-men at one time or another.\\nTill yu' got accustomed, it would give 'most anybody a shock to hear 'em\\nspeak about herdin' the bulls in a pasture by themselves.” The Virginian\\nallowed himself another smile, but became serious again. “That was their\\npolicy,” he explained. “Except at certain times o' year they kept the\\nbulls separate. The Fish Commission told 'em they'd better, and it\\ncert'nly worked mighty well. It or something did--for, gentlemen, hush!\\nbut there was millions. You'd have said all the frawgs in the world had\\ntaken charge at Tulare. And the money rolled in! Gentlemen, hush! 'twas\\na gold mine for the owners. Forty per cent they netted some years.\\nAnd they paid generous wages. For they could sell to all them French\\nrestaurants in San Francisco, yu' see. And there was the Cliff House.\\nAnd the Palace Hotel made it a specialty. And the officers took frawgs\\nat the Presidio, an' Angel Island, an' Alcatraz, an' Benicia. Los\\nAngeles was beginnin' its boom. The corner-lot sharps wanted something\\nby way of varnish. An' so they dazzled Eastern investors with\\nadvertisin' Tulare frawgs clear to New Orleans an' New York. 'Twas only\\nin Sacramento frawgs was dull. I expaict the California legislature\\nwas too or'n'ry for them fine-raised luxuries. They tell of one of them\\nsenators that he raked a million out of Los Angeles real estate, and\\nstarted in for a bang-up meal with champagne. Wanted to scatter his new\\ngold thick an' quick. But he got astray among all the fancy dishes,\\nan' just yelled right out before the ladies, 'Damn it! bring me forty\\ndollars' worth of ham and aiggs.' He was a funny senator, now.”\\n\\nThe Virginian paused, and finished eating a leg. And then with diabolic\\nart he made a feint at wandering to new fields of anecdote. “Talkin' of\\nsenators,” he resumed, “Senator Wise--”\\n\\n“How much did you say wages were at Tulare?” inquired one of the Trampas\\nfaction.\\n\\n“How much? Why, I never knew what the foreman got. The regular hands got\\na hundred. Senator Wise--”\\n\\n“A hundred a MONTH?”\\n\\n“Why, it was wet an' muddy work, yu' see. A man risked rheumatism some.\\nHe risked it a good deal. Well, I was going to tell about Senator Wise.\\nWhen Senator Wise was speaking of his visit to Alaska--”\\n\\n“Forty per cent, was it?” said Trampas.\\n\\n“Oh, I must call my wife,” said the traveller behind me. “This is what I\\ncame West for.” And he hurried away.\\n\\n“Not forty per cent the bad years,” replied the Virginian. “The frawgs\\nhad enemies, same as cattle. I remember when a pelican got in the spring\\npasture, and the herd broke through the fence--”\\n\\n“Fence?” said a passenger.\\n\\n“Ditch, seh, and wire net. Every pasture was a square swamp with a ditch\\naround, and a wire net. Yu've heard the mournful, mixed-up sound a big\\nbunch of cattle will make? Well, seh, as yu' druv from the railroad to\\nthe Tulare frawg ranch yu' could hear 'em a mile. Springtime they'd sing\\nlike girls in the organ loft, and by August they were about ready to\\nhire out for bass. And all was fit to be soloists, if I'm a judge. But\\nin a bad year it might only be twenty per cent. The pelican rushed 'em\\nfrom the pasture right into the San Joaquin River, which was close\\nby the property. The big balance of the herd stampeded, and though of\\ncourse they came out on the banks again, the news had went around, and\\nfolks below at Hemlen eat most of 'em just to spite the company. Yu'\\nsee, a frawg in a river is more hopeless than any maverick loose on the\\nrange. And they never struck any plan to brand their stock and prove\\nownership.”\\n\\n“Well, twenty per cent is good enough for me,” said Trampas, “if Rawhide\\ndon't suit me.”\\n\\n“A hundred a month!” said the enthusiast. And busy calculations began to\\narise among them.\\n\\n“It went to fifty per cent,” pursued the Virginian, “when New York and\\nPhiladelphia got to biddin' agaynst each other. Both cities had signs\\nall over 'em claiming to furnish the Tulare frawg. And both had 'em all\\nright. And same as cattle trains, yu'd see frawg trains tearing acrosst\\nArizona--big glass tanks with wire over 'em--through to New York, an'\\nthe frawgs starin' out.”\\n\\n“Why, George,” whispered a woman's voice behind me, “he's merely\\ndeceiving them! He's merely making that stuff up out of his head.”\\n\\n“Yes, my dear, that's merely what he's doing.”\\n\\n“Well, I don't see why you imagined I should care for this. I think I'll\\ngo back.”\\n\\n“Better see it out, Daisy. This beats the geysers or anything we're\\nlikely to find in the Yellowstone.”\\n\\n“Then I wish we had gone to Bar Harbor as usual,” said the lady, and she\\nreturned to her Pullman.\\n\\nBut her husband stayed. Indeed, the male crowd now was a goodly sight\\nto see, how the men edged close, drawn by a common tie. Their different\\nkinds of feet told the strength of the bond--yellow sleeping-car\\nslippers planted miscellaneous and motionless near a pair of Mexican\\nspurs. All eyes watched the Virginian and gave him their entire\\nsympathy. Though they could not know his motive for it, what he was\\ndoing had fallen as light upon them--all except the excited calculators.\\nThese were loudly making their fortunes at both Rawhide and Tulare,\\ndrugged by their satanically aroused hopes of gold, heedless of the\\nslippers and the spurs. Had a man given any sign to warn them, I think\\nhe would have been lynched. Even the Indian chiefs had come to see in\\ntheir show war bonnets and blankets. They naturally understood nothing\\nof it, yet magnetically knew that the Virginian was the great man. And\\nthey watched him with approval. He sat by the fire with the frying-pan,\\nlooking his daily self--engaging and saturnine. And now as Trampas\\ndeclared tickets to California would be dear and Rawhide had better come\\nfirst, the Southerner let loose his heaven-born imagination.\\n\\n“There's a better reason for Rawhide than tickets, Trampas,” said he. “I\\nsaid it was too late for Tulare.”\\n\\n“I heard you,” said Trampas. “Opinions may differ. You and I don't think\\nalike on several points.”\\n\\n“Gawd, Trampas!” said the Virginian, “d' yu' reckon I'd be rotting hyeh\\non forty dollars if Tulare was like it used to be? Tulare is broke.”\\n\\n“What broke it? Your leaving?”\\n\\n“Revenge broke it, and disease,” said the Virginian, striking the\\nfrying-pan on his knee, for the frogs were all gone. At those lurid\\nwords their untamed child minds took fire, and they drew round him again\\nto hear a tale of blood. The crowd seemed to lean nearer.\\n\\nBut for a short moment it threatened to be spoiled. A passenger came\\nalong, demanding in an important voice, “Where are these frogs?” He was\\na prominent New York after-dinner speaker, they whispered me, and\\nout for a holiday in his private car. Reaching us and walking to the\\nVirginian, he said cheerily, “How much do you want for your frogs, my\\nfriend?”\\n\\n“You got a friend hyeh?” said the Virginian. “That's good, for yu'\\nneed care taken of yu'.” And the prominent after-dinner speaker did not\\nfurther discommode us.\\n\\n“That's worth my trip,” whispered a New York passenger to me.\\n\\n“Yes, it was a case of revenge,” resumed the Virginian, “and disease.\\nThere was a man named Saynt Augustine got run out of Domingo, which is\\na Dago island. He come to Philadelphia, an' he was dead broke. But Saynt\\nAugustine was a live man, an' he saw Philadelphia was full o' Quakers\\nthat dressed plain an' eat humdrum. So he started cookin' Domingo\\nway for 'em, an' they caught right ahold. Terrapin, he gave 'em,\\nan' croakeets, an' he'd use forty chickens to make a broth he called\\nconsommay. An' he got rich, and Philadelphia got well known, an'\\nDelmonico in New York he got jealous. He was the cook that had the\\nsay-so in New York.”\\n\\n“Was Delmonico one of them I-talians?” inquired a fascinated mutineer.\\n\\n“I don't know. But he acted like one. Lorenzo was his front name. He\\naimed to cut--”\\n\\n“Domingo's throat?” breathed the enthusiast.\\n\\n“Aimed to cut away the trade from Saynt Augustine an' put Philadelphia\\nback where he thought she belonged. Frawgs was the fashionable rage\\nthen. These foreign cooks set the fashion in eatin', same as foreign\\ndressmakers do women's clothes. Both cities was catchin' and swallowin'\\nall the frawgs Tulare could throw at 'em. So he--”\\n\\n“Lorenzo?” said the enthusiast.\\n\\n“Yes, Lorenzo Delmonico. He bid a dollar a tank higher. An' Saynt\\nAugustine raised him fifty cents. An' Lorenzo raised him a dollar.\\nAn' Saynt Augustine shoved her up three. Lorenzo he didn't expect\\nPhiladelphia would go that high, and he got hot in the collar, an' flew\\nround his kitchen in New York, an' claimed he'd twist Saynt Augustine's\\nDomingo tail for him and crack his ossified system. Lorenzo raised his\\nlanguage to a high temperature, they say. An' then quite sudden off\\nhe starts for Tulare. He buys tickets over the Santa Fe, and he goes\\na-fannin' and a-foggin'. But, gentlemen, hush! The very same day Saynt\\nAugustine he tears out of Philadelphia. He travelled by the way o'\\nWashington, an' out he comes a-fannin' an' a-foggin' over the Southern\\nPacific. Of course Tulare didn't know nothin' of this. All it knowed\\nwas how the frawg market was on soarin' wings, and it was feelin' like\\na flight o' rawckets. If only there'd been some preparation,--a telegram\\nor something,--the disaster would never have occurred. But Lorenzo and\\nSaynt Augustine was that absorbed watchin' each other--for, yu' see, the\\nSanta Fe and the Southern Pacific come together at Mojave, an' the\\ntwo cooks travelled a matter of two hundred an' ten miles in the\\nsame cyar--they never thought about a telegram. And when they arruv,\\nbreathless, an' started in to screechin' what they'd give for the\\nmonopoly, why, them unsuspectin' Tulare boys got amused at 'em. I never\\nheard just all they done, but they had Lorenzo singin' and dancin',\\nwhile Saynt Augustine played the fiddle for him. And one of Lorenzo's\\nheels did get a trifle grazed. Well, them two cooks quit that ranch\\nwithout disclosin' their identity, and soon as they got to a safe\\ndistance they swore eternal friendship, in their excitable foreign way.\\nAnd they went home over the Union Pacific, sharing the same stateroom.\\nTheir revenge killed frawgs. The disease--”\\n\\n“How killed frogs?” demanded Trampas.\\n\\n“Just killed 'em. Delmonico and Saynt Augustine wiped frawgs off the\\nslate of fashion. Not a banker in Fifth Avenue'll touch one now if\\nanother banker's around watchin' him. And if ever yu' see a man that\\nhides his feet an' won't take off his socks in company, he has worked in\\nthem Tulare swamps an' got the disease. Catch him wadin', and yu'll find\\nhe's web-footed. Frawgs are dead, Trampas, and so are you.”\\n\\n“Rise up, liars, and salute your king!” yelled Scipio. “Oh, I'm in love\\nwith you!” And he threw his arms round the Virginian.\\n\\n“Let me shake hands with you,” said the traveller, who had failed to\\ninterest his wife in these things. “I wish I was going to have more of\\nyour company.”\\n\\n“Thank ye', seh,” said the Virginian.\\n\\nOther passengers greeted him, and the Indian chiefs came, saying, “How!”\\n because they followed their feelings without understanding.\\n\\n“Don't show so humbled, boys,” said the deputy foreman to his most\\nsheepish crew. “These gentlemen from the East have been enjoying yu'\\nsome, I know. But think what a weary wait they have had hyeh. And you\\ninsisted on playing the game with me this way, yu' see. What outlet did\\nyu' give me? Didn't I have it to do? And I'll tell yu' one thing\\nfor your consolation: when I got to the middle of the frawgs I 'most\\nbelieved it myself.” And he laughed out the first laugh I had heard him\\ngive.\\n\\nThe enthusiast came up and shook hands. That led off, and the rest\\nfollowed, with Trampas at the end. The tide was too strong for him. He\\nwas not a graceful loser; but he got through this, and the Virginian\\neased him down by treating him precisely like the others--apparently.\\nPossibly the supreme--the most American--moment of all was when word\\ncame that the bridge was open, and the Pullman trains, with noise and\\ntriumph, began to move westward at last. Every one waved farewell to\\nevery one, craning from steps and windows, so that the cars twinkled\\nwith hilarity; and in twenty minutes the whole procession in front had\\nmoved, and our turn came.\\n\\n“Last chance for Rawhide,” said the Virginian.\\n\\n“Last chance for Sunk Creek,” said a reconstructed mutineer, and all\\nsprang aboard. There was no question who had won his spurs now.\\n\\nOur caboose trundled on to Billings along the shingly cotton-wooded\\nYellowstone; and as the plains and bluffs and the distant snow began to\\ngrow well known, even to me, we turned to our baggage that was to come\\noff, since camp would begin in the morning. Thus I saw the Virginian\\ncarefully rewrapping Kenilworth, that he might bring it to its owner\\nunharmed; and I said, “Don't you think you could have played poker with\\nQueen Elizabeth?”\\n\\n“No; I expaict she'd have beat me,” he replied. “She was a lady.”\\n\\nIt was at Billings, on this day, that I made those reflections about\\nequality. For the Virginian had been equal to the occasion: that is the\\nonly kind of equality which I recognize.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXVII. SCIPIO MORALIZES\\n\\n\\nInto what mood was it that the Virginian now fell? Being less busy,\\ndid he begin to “grieve” about the girl on Bear Creek? I only know\\nthat after talking so lengthily he fell into a nine days' silence. The\\ntalking part of him deeply and unbrokenly slept.\\n\\nOfficial words of course came from him as we rode southward from the\\nrailroad, gathering the Judge's stray cattle. During the many weeks\\nsince the spring round-up, some of these animals had as usual got\\nvery far off their range, and getting them on again became the present\\nbusiness of our party.\\n\\nDirections and commands--whatever communications to his subordinates\\nwere needful to the forwarding of this--he duly gave. But routine has\\nnever at any time of the world passed for conversation. His utterances,\\nsuch as, “We'll work Willo' Creek to-morro' mawnin',” or, “I want the\\nwagon to be at the fawks o' Stinkin' Water by Thursday,” though on some\\noccasions numerous enough to sound like discourse, never once broke the\\nman's true silence. Seeming to keep easy company with the camp, he yet\\nkept altogether to himself. That talking part of him--the mood which\\nbrings out for you your friend's spirit and mind as a free gift or as an\\nexchange--was down in some dark cave of his nature, hidden away. Perhaps\\nit had been dreaming; perhaps completely reposing. The Virginian was one\\nof those rare ones who are able to refresh themselves in sections. To\\nhave a thing on his mind did not keep his body from resting. During our\\nrecent journey--it felt years ago now!--while our caboose on the freight\\ntrain had trundled endlessly westward, and the men were on the ragged\\nedge, the very jumping-off place, of mutiny and possible murder, I had\\nseen him sleep like a child. He snatched the moments not necessary for\\nvigil. I had also seen him sit all night watching his responsibility,\\nready to spring on it and fasten his teeth in it. And now that he had\\nconfounded them with their own attempted weapon of ridicule, his powers\\nseemed to be profoundly dormant. That final pitched battle of wits had\\nmade the men his captives and admirers--all save Trampas. And of him the\\nVirginian did not seem to be aware.\\n\\nBut Scipio le Moyne would say to me now and then, “If I was Trampas, I'd\\npull my freight.” And once he added, “Pull it kind of casual, yu' know,\\nlike I wasn't noticing myself do it.”\\n\\n“Yes,” our friend Shorty murmured pregnantly, with his eye upon the\\nquiet Virginian, “he's sure studying his revenge.”\\n\\n“Studying your pussy-cat,” said Scipio. “He knows what he'll do. The\\ntime ain't arrived.” This was the way they felt about it; and not\\nunnaturally this was the way they made me, the inexperienced Easterner,\\nfeel about it. That Trampas also felt something about it was easy\\nto know. Like the leaven which leavens the whole lump, one spot of\\nsulkiness in camp will spread its dull flavor through any company that\\nsits near it; and we had to sit near Trampas at meals for nine days.\\n\\nHis sullenness was not wonderful. To feel himself forsaken by his recent\\nadherents, to see them gone over to his enemy, could not have made\\nhis reflections pleasant. Why he did not take himself off to other\\nclimes--“pull his freight casual,” as Scipio said--I can explain only\\nthus: pay was due him--“time,” as it was called in cow-land; if he would\\nhave this money, he must stay under the Virginian's command until the\\nJudge's ranch on Sunk Creek should be reached; meanwhile, each day's\\nwork added to the wages in store for him; and finally, once at Sunk\\nCreek, it would be no more the Virginian who commanded him; it would be\\nthe real ranch foreman. At the ranch he would be the Virginian's equal\\nagain, both of them taking orders from their officially recognized\\nsuperior, this foreman. Shorty's word about “revenge” seemed to me\\nlike putting the thing backwards. Revenge, as I told Scipio, was what I\\nshould be thinking about if I were Trampas.\\n\\n“He dassent,” was Scipio's immediate view. “Not till he's got strong\\nagain. He got laughed plumb sick by the bystanders, and whatever spirit\\nhe had was broke in the presence of us all. He'll have to recuperate.”\\n Scipio then spoke of the Virginian's attitude. “Maybe revenge ain't just\\nthe right word for where this affair has got to now with him. When yu'\\nbeat another man at his own game like he done to Trampas, why, yu've had\\nall the revenge yu' can want, unless you're a hog. And he's no hog. But\\nhe has got it in for Trampas. They've not reckoned to a finish. Would\\nyou let a man try such spite-work on you and quit thinkin' about him\\njust because yu'd headed him off?” To this I offered his own notion\\nabout hogs and being satisfied. “Hogs!” went on Scipio, in a way that\\ndashed my suggestion to pieces; “hogs ain't in the case. He's got to\\ndeal with Trampas somehow--man to man. Trampas and him can't stay this\\nway when they get back and go workin' same as they worked before. No,\\nsir; I've seen his eye twice, and I know he's goin' to reckon to a\\nfinish.”\\n\\nI still must, in Scipio's opinion, have been slow to understand, when on\\nthe afternoon following this talk I invited him to tell me what sort\\nof “finish” he wanted, after such a finishing as had been dealt Trampas\\nalready. Getting “laughed plumb sick by the bystanders” (I borrowed his\\nown not overstated expression) seemed to me a highly final finishing.\\nWhile I was running my notions off to him, Scipio rose, and, with the\\nfrying-pan he had been washing, walked slowly at me.\\n\\n“I do believe you'd oughtn't to be let travel alone the way you do.”\\n He put his face close to mine. His long nose grew eloquent in its\\nshrewdness, while the fire in his bleached blue eye burned with amiable\\nsatire. “What has come and gone between them two has only settled the\\none point he was aimin' to make. He was appointed boss of this outfit in\\nthe absence of the regular foreman. Since then all he has been playin'\\nfor is to hand back his men to the ranch in as good shape as they'd been\\nhanded to him, and without losing any on the road through desertion or\\nshooting or what not. He had to kick his cook off the train that day,\\nand the loss made him sorrowful, I could see. But I'd happened to come\\nalong, and he jumped me into the vacancy, and I expect he is pretty near\\nconsoled. And as boss of the outfit he beat Trampas, who was settin' up\\nfor opposition boss. And the outfit is better than satisfied it come out\\nthat way, and they're stayin' with him; and he'll hand them all back in\\ngood condition, barrin' that lost cook. So for the present his point is\\nmade, yu' see. But look ahead a little. It may not be so very far ahead\\nyu'll have to look. We get back to the ranch. He's not boss there any\\nmore. His responsibility is over. He is just one of us again, taking\\norders from a foreman they tell me has showed partiality to Trampas\\nmore'n a few times. Partiality! That's what Trampas is plainly trusting\\nto. Trusting it will fix him all right and fix his enemy all wrong.\\nHe'd not otherwise dare to keep sour like he's doing. Partiality! D' yu'\\nthink it'll scare off the enemy?” Scipio looked across a little creek\\nto where the Virginian was helping throw the gathered cattle on the\\nbedground. “What odds”--he pointed the frying-pan at the Southerner--“d'\\nyu' figure Trampas's being under any foreman's wing will make to a man\\nlike him? He's going to remember Mr. Trampas and his spite-work if he's\\ngot to tear him out from under the wing, and maybe tear off the wing in\\nthe operation. And I am goin' to advise your folks,” ended the complete\\nScipio, “not to leave you travel so much alone--not till you've learned\\nmore life.”\\n\\nHe had made me feel my inexperience, convinced me of innocence,\\nundoubtedly; and during the final days of our journey I no longer\\ninvoked his aid to my reflections upon this especial topic: What would\\nthe Virginian do to Trampas? Would it be another intellectual crushing\\nof him, like the frog story, or would there be something this time more\\nmaterial--say muscle, or possibly gunpowder--in it? And was Scipio,\\nafter all, infallible? I didn't pretend to understand the Virginian;\\nafter several years' knowledge of him he remained utterly beyond me.\\nScipio's experience was not yet three weeks long. So I let him alone as\\nto all this, discussing with him most other things good and evil in\\nthe world, and being convinced of much further innocence; for Scipio's\\ntwenty odd years were indeed a library of life. I have never met a\\nbetter heart, a shrewder wit, and looser morals, with yet a native sense\\nof decency and duty somewhere hard and fast enshrined.\\n\\nBut all the while I was wondering about the Virginian: eating with him,\\nsleeping with him (only not so sound as he did), and riding beside him\\noften for many hours.\\n\\nExperiments in conversation I did make--and failed. One day particularly\\nwhile, after a sudden storm of hail had chilled the earth numb and white\\nlike winter in fifteen minutes, we sat drying and warming ourselves by\\na fire that we built, I touched upon that theme of equality on which I\\nknew him to hold opinions as strong as mine. “Oh,” he would reply, and\\n“Cert'nly”; and when I asked him what it was in a man that made him a\\nleader of men, he shook his head and puffed his pipe. So then, noticing\\nhow the sun had brought the earth in half an hour back from winter to\\nsummer again, I spoke of our American climate.\\n\\nIt was a potent drug, I said, for millions to be swallowing every day.\\n\\n“Yes,” said he, wiping the damp from his Winchester rifle.\\n\\nOur American climate, I said, had worked remarkable changes, at least.\\n\\n“Yes,” he said; and did not ask what they were.\\n\\nSo I had to tell him. “It has made successful politicians of the Irish.\\nThat's one. And it has given our whole race the habit of poker.”\\n\\nBang went his Winchester. The bullet struck close to my left. I sat up\\nangrily.\\n\\n“That's the first foolish thing I ever saw you do!” I said.\\n\\n“Yes,” he drawled slowly, “I'd ought to have done it sooner. He was\\npretty near lively again.” And then he picked up a rattlesnake six feet\\nbehind me. It had been numbed by the hail, part revived by the sun, and\\nhe had shot its head off.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXVIII. “WOULD YOU BE A PARSON?”\\n\\n\\nAfter this I gave up my experiments in conversation. So that by the\\nfinal afternoon of our journey, with Sunk Creek actually in sight, and\\nthe great grasshoppers slatting their dry song over the sage-brush, and\\nthe time at hand when the Virginian and Trampas would be “man to man,”\\n my thoughts rose to a considerable pitch of speculation.\\n\\nAnd now that talking part of the Virginian, which had been nine days\\nasleep, gave its first yawn and stretch of waking. Without preface, he\\nsuddenly asked me, “Would you be a parson?”\\n\\nI was mentally so far away that I couldn't get back in time to\\ncomprehend or answer before he had repeated: “What would yu' take to be\\na parson?”\\n\\nHe drawled it out in his gentle way, precisely as if no nine days stood\\nbetween it and our last real intercourse.\\n\\n“Take?” I was still vaguely moving in my distance. “How?”\\n\\nHis next question brought me home.\\n\\n“I expect the Pope's is the biggest of them parson jobs?”\\n\\nIt was with an “Oh!” that I now entirely took his idea. “Well, yes;\\ndecidedly the biggest.”\\n\\n“Beats the English one? Archbishop--ain't it?--of Canterbury? The Pope\\ncomes ahead of him?”\\n\\n“His Holiness would say so if his Grace did not.”\\n\\nThe Virginian turned half in his saddle to see my face--I was, at the\\nmoment, riding not quite abreast of him--and I saw the gleam of his\\nteeth beneath his mustache. It was seldom I could make him smile, even\\nto this slight extent. But his eyes grew, with his next words, remote\\nagain in their speculation.\\n\\n“His Holiness and his Grace. Now if I was to hear 'em namin' me\\nthat-a-way every mawnin', I'd sca'cely get down to business.”\\n\\n“Oh, you'd get used to the pride of it.”\\n\\n“'Tisn't the pride. The laugh is what would ruin me. 'Twould take 'most\\nall my attention keeping a straight face. The Archbishop”--here he\\ntook one of his wide mental turns--“is apt to be a big man in them\\nShakespeare plays. Kings take talk from him they'd not stand from\\nanybody else; and he talks fine, frequently. About the bees, for\\ninstance, when Henry is going to fight France. He tells him a beehive\\nis similar to a kingdom. I learned that piece.” The Virginian could not\\nhave expected to blush at uttering these last words. He knew that his\\nsudden color must tell me in whose book it was he had learned the piece.\\nWas not her copy of Kenilworth even now in his cherishing pocket? So\\nhe now, to cover his blush, very deliberately recited to me the\\nArchbishop's discourse upon bees and their kingdom:\\n\\n     “'Where some, like magistrates, correct at home...\\n      Others, like soldiers, armed in their stings,\\n      Make loot upon the summer's velvet buds;\\n      Which pillage they with merry march bring home\\n      To the tent-royal of their emperor:\\n      He, busied in his majesty, surveys\\n      The singing masons building roofs of gold.'\\n\\n“Ain't that a fine description of bees a-workin'? 'The singing masons\\nbuilding roofs of gold!' Puts 'em right before yu', and is poetry\\nwithout bein' foolish. His Holiness and his Grace. Well, they could not\\nhire me for either o' those positions. How many religions are there?”\\n\\n“All over the earth?”\\n\\n“Yu' can begin with ourselves. Right hyeh at home I know there's\\nRomanists, and Episcopals--”\\n\\n“Two kinds!” I put in. “At least two of Episcopals.”\\n\\n“That's three. Then Methodists and Baptists, and--”\\n\\n“Three Methodists!”\\n\\n“Well, you do the countin'.”\\n\\nI accordingly did it, feeling my revolving memory slip cogs all the way\\nround. “Anyhow, there are safely fifteen.”\\n\\n“Fifteen.” He held this fact a moment. “And they don't worship a whole\\nheap o' different gods like the ancients did?”\\n\\n“Oh, no!”\\n\\n“It's just the same one?”\\n\\n“The same one.”\\n\\nThe Virginian folded his hands over the horn of his saddle, and leaned\\nforward upon them in contemplation of the wide, beautiful landscape.\\n\\n“One God and fifteen religions,” was his reflection. “That's a right\\nsmart of religions for just one God.”\\n\\nThis way of reducing it was, if obvious to him, so novel to me that my\\nlaugh evidently struck him as a louder and livelier comment than was\\nrequired. He turned on me as if I had somehow perverted the spirit of\\nhis words.\\n\\n“I ain't religious. I know that. But I ain't unreligious. And I know\\nthat too.”\\n\\n“So do I know it, my friend.”\\n\\n“Do you think there ought to be fifteen varieties of good people?” His\\nvoice, while it now had an edge that could cut anything it came against,\\nwas still not raised. “There ain't fifteen. There ain't two. There's one\\nkind. And when I meet it, I respect it. It is not praying nor preaching\\nthat has ever caught me and made me ashamed of myself, but one or two\\npeople I have knowed that never said a superior word to me. They thought\\nmore o' me than I deserved, and that made me behave better than I\\nnaturally wanted to. Made me quit a girl onced in time for her not to\\nlose her good name. And so that's one thing I have never done. And if\\never I was to have a son or somebody I set store by, I would wish their\\nlot to be to know one or two good folks mighty well--men or women--women\\npreferred.”\\n\\nHe had looked away again to the hills behind Sunk Creek ranch, to which\\nour walking horses had now almost brought us.\\n\\n“As for parsons “--the gesture of his arm was a disclaiming one--“I\\nreckon some parsons have a right to tell yu' to be good. The bishop\\nof this hyeh Territory has a right. But I'll tell yu' this: a middlin'\\ndoctor is a pore thing, and a middlin' lawyer is a pore thing; but keep\\nme from a middlin' man of God.”\\n\\nOnce again he had reduced it, but I did not laugh this time. I thought\\nthere should in truth be heavy damages for malpractice on human souls.\\nBut the hot glow of his words, and the vision of his deepest inner man\\nit revealed, faded away abruptly.\\n\\n“What do yu' make of the proposition yondeh?” As he pointed to the cause\\nof this question he had become again his daily, engaging, saturnine\\nself.\\n\\nThen I saw over in a fenced meadow, to which we were now close, what he\\nwas pleased to call “the proposition.” Proposition in the West does, in\\nfact, mean whatever you at the moment please,--an offer to sell you a\\nmine, a cloud-burst, a glass of whiskey, a steamboat. This time it meant\\na stranger clad in black, and of a clerical deportment which would in\\nthat atmosphere and to a watchful eye be visible for a mile or two.\\n\\n“I reckoned yu' hadn't noticed him,” was the Virginian's reply to my\\nejaculation. “Yes. He set me goin' on the subject a while back. I expect\\nhe is another missionary to us pore cow-boys.”\\n\\nI seemed from a hundred yards to feel the stranger's forceful\\npersonality. It was in his walk--I should better say stalk--as he\\npromenaded along the creek. His hands were behind his back, and there\\nwas an air of waiting, of displeased waiting, in his movement.\\n\\n“Yes, he'll be a missionary,” said the Virginian, conclusively; and he\\ntook to singing, or rather to whining, with his head tilted at an absurd\\nangle upward at the sky:\\n\\n     “'Dar is a big Car'lina nigger,\\n      About de size of dis chile or p'raps a little bigger,\\n      By de name of Jim Crow.\\n      Dat what de white folks call him.\\n      If ever I sees him I 'tends for to maul him,\\n      Just to let de white folks see\\n      Such an animos as he\\n      Can't walk around the streets and scandalize me.'”\\n\\nThe lane which was conducting us to the group of ranch buildings now\\nturned a corner of the meadow, and the Virginian went on with his second\\nverse:\\n\\n    “'Great big fool, he hasn't any knowledge.\\n    Gosh! how could he, when he's never been to scollege?\\n    Neither has I.\\n    But I'se come mighty nigh;\\n    I peaked through de door as I went by.'”\\n\\nHe was beginning a third stanza, but stopped short; a horse had neighed\\nclose behind us.\\n\\n“Trampas,” said he, without turning his head, “we are home.”\\n\\n“It looks that way.” Some ten yards were between ourselves and Trampas,\\nwhere he followed.\\n\\n“And I'll trouble yu' for my rope yu' took this mawnin' instead o' your\\nown.”\\n\\n“I don't know as it's your rope I've got.” Trampas skilfully spoke this\\nso that a precisely opposite meaning flowed from his words.\\n\\nIf it was discussion he tried for, he failed. The Virginian's hand\\nmoved, and for one thick, flashing moment my thoughts were evidently\\nalso the thoughts of Trampas. But the Virginian only held out to Trampas\\nthe rope which he had detached from his saddle.\\n\\n“Take your hand off your gun, Trampas. If I had wanted to kill yu'\\nyou'd be lying nine days back on the road now. Here's your rope. Did yu'\\nexpect I'd not know it? It's the only one in camp the stiffness ain't\\nall drug out of yet. Or maybe yu' expected me to notice and--not take\\nnotice?”\\n\\n“I don't spend my time in expectations about you. If--”\\n\\nThe Virginian wheeled his horse across the road. “Yu're talkin' too soon\\nafter reachin' safety, Trampas. I didn't tell yu' to hand me that rope\\nthis mawnin', because I was busy. I ain't foreman now; and I want that\\nrope.”\\n\\nTrampas produced a smile as skilful as his voice. “Well, I guess your\\nhaving mine proves this one is yours.” He rode up and received the coil\\nwhich the Virginian held out, unloosing the disputed one on his saddle.\\nIf he had meant to devise a slippery, evasive insult, no small trick in\\ncow-land could be more offensive than this taking another man's rope.\\nAnd it is the small tricks which lead to the big bullets. Trampas put\\na smooth coating of plausibility over the whole transaction. “After\\nthe rope corral we had to make this morning”--his tone was mock\\nexplanatory--“the ropes was all strewed round camp, and in the hustle\\nI--”\\n\\n“Pardon me,” said a sonorous voice behind us, “do you happen to have\\nseen Judge Henry?” It was the reverend gentleman in his meadow, come\\nto the fence. As we turned round to him he spoke on, with much rotund\\nauthority in his eye. “From his answer to my letter, Judge Henry\\nundoubtedly expects me here. I have arrived from Fetterman according to\\nmy plan which I announced to him, to find that he has been absent all\\nday--absent the whole day.”\\n\\nThe Virginian sat sidewise to talk, one long, straight leg supporting\\nhim on one stirrup, the other bent at ease, the boot half lifted from\\nits dangling stirrup. He made himself the perfection of courtesy. “The\\nJudge is frequently absent all night, seh.”\\n\\n“Scarcely to-night, I think. I thought you might know something about\\nhim.”\\n\\n“I have been absent myself, seh.”\\n\\n“Ah! On a vacation, perhaps?” The divine had a ruddy facet. His strong\\nglance was straight and frank and fearless; but his smile too much\\nreminded me of days bygone, when we used to return to school from the\\nChristmas holidays, and the masters would shake our hands and welcome\\nus with: “Robert, John, Edward, glad to see you all looking so well!\\nRested, and ready for hard work, I'm sure!”\\n\\nThat smile does not really please even good, tame little boys; and the\\nVirginian was nearing thirty.\\n\\n“It has not been vacation this trip, seh,” said he, settling straight in\\nhis saddle. “There's the Judge driving in now, in time for all questions\\nyu' have to ask him.”\\n\\nHis horse took a step, but was stopped short. There lay the Virginian's\\nrope on the ground. I had been aware of Trampas's quite proper departure\\nduring the talk; and as he was leaving, I seemed also to be aware of\\nhis placing the coil across the cantle of its owner's saddle. Had he\\nintended it to fall and have to be picked up? It was another evasive\\nlittle business, and quite successful, if designed to nag the owner of\\nthe rope. A few hundred yards ahead of us Trampas was now shouting loud\\ncow-boy shouts. Were they to announce his return to those at home, or\\ndid they mean derision? The Virginian leaned, keeping his seat, and,\\nswinging down his arm, caught up the rope, and hung it on his saddle\\nsomewhat carefully. But the hue of rage spread over his face.\\n\\nFrom his fence the divine now spoke, in approbation, but with another\\nstrong, cheerless smile. “You pick up that rope as if you were well\\ntrained to it.”\\n\\n“It's part of our business, seh, and we try to mind it like the rest.”\\n But this, stated in a gentle drawl, did not pierce the missionary's\\narmor; his superiority was very thick.\\n\\nWe now rode on, and I was impressed by the reverend gentleman's robust,\\ndictatorial back as he proceeded by a short cut through the meadow\\nto the ranch. You could take him for nothing but a vigorous, sincere,\\ndominating man, full of the highest purpose. But whatever his creed, I\\nalready doubted if he were the right one to sow it and make it grow in\\nthese new, wild fields. He seemed more the sort of gardener to keep\\nold walks and vines pruned in their antique rigidity. I admired him for\\ncoming all this way with his clean, short, gray whiskers and his black,\\nwell-brushed suit. And he made me think of a powerful locomotive stuck\\npuffing on a grade.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Virginian rode beside me, so silent in his volcanic wrath\\nthat I did not perceive it. The missionary coming on top of Trampas\\nhad been more than he could stand. But I did not know, and I spoke with\\ninnocent cheeriness.\\n\\n“Is the parson going to save us?” I asked; and I fairly jumped at\\nhis voice: “Don't talk so much!” he burst out. I had got the whole\\naccumulation!\\n\\n“Who's been talking?” I in equal anger screeched back. “I'm not trying\\nto save you. I didn't take your rope.” And having poured this out, I\\nwhipped up my pony.\\n\\nBut he spurred his own alongside of me; and glancing at him, I saw that\\nhe was now convulsed with internal mirth. I therefore drew down to a\\nwalk, and he straightened into gravity.\\n\\n“I'm right obliged to yu',” he laid his hand in its buckskin gauntlet\\nupon my horse's mane as he spoke, “for bringing me back out o' my\\nnonsense. I'll be as serene as a bird now--whatever they do. A man,”\\n he stated reflectively, “any full-sized man, ought to own a big lot of\\ntemper. And like all his valuable possessions, he'd ought to keep it and\\nnot lose any.” This was his full apology. “As for salvation, I have got\\nthis far: somebody,” he swept an arm at the sunset and the mountains,\\n“must have made all that, I know. But I know one more thing I would tell\\nHim to His face: if I can't do nothing long enough and good enough to\\nearn eternal happiness, I can't do nothing long enough and bad enough to\\nbe damned. I reckon He plays a square game with us if He plays at all,\\nand I ain't bothering my haid about other worlds.”\\n\\nAs we reached the stables, he had become the serene bird he promised,\\nand was sentimentally continuing:\\n\\n     “'De sun is made of mud from de bottom of de river;\\n     De moon is made o' fox-fire, as you might disciver;\\n     De stars like de ladies' eyes,\\n     All round de world dey flies,\\n     To give a little light when de moon don't rise.'”\\n\\nIf words were meant to conceal our thoughts, melody is perhaps a still\\nthicker veil for them. Whatever temper he had lost, he had certainly\\nfound again; but this all the more fitted him to deal with Trampas, when\\nthe dealing should begin. I had half a mind to speak to the Judge, only\\nit seemed beyond a mere visitor's business. Our missionary was at this\\nmoment himself speaking to Judge Henry at the door of the home ranch.\\n\\n“I reckon he's explaining he has been a-waiting.” The Virginian was\\nthrowing his saddle off as I loosened the cinches of mine. “And the\\nJudge don't look like he was hopelessly distressed.”\\n\\nI now surveyed the distant parley, and the Judge, from the wagonful of\\nguests whom he had evidently been driving upon a day's excursion, waved\\nme a welcome, which I waved back. “He's got Miss Molly Wood there!” I\\nexclaimed.\\n\\n“Yes.” The Virginian was brief about this fact. “I'll look afteh your\\nsaddle. You go and get acquainted with the company.”\\n\\nThis favor I accepted; it was the means he chose for saying he hoped,\\nafter our recent boiling over, that all was now more than right between\\nus. So for the while I left him to his horses, and his corrals, and his\\nTrampas, and his foreman, and his imminent problem.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXIX. DR. MACBRIDE BEGS PARDON\\n\\n\\nJudge and Mrs. Henry, Molly Wood, and two strangers, a lady and\\na gentleman, were the party which had been driving in the large\\nthree-seated wagon. They had seemed a merry party. But as I came within\\nhearing of their talk, it was a fragment of the minister's sonority\\nwhich reached me first: “--more opportunity for them to have the benefit\\nof hearing frequent sermons,” was the sentence I heard him bring to\\ncompletion.\\n\\n“Yes, to be sure, sir.” Judge Henry gave me (it almost seemed)\\nadditional warmth of welcome for arriving to break up the present\\ndiscourse. “Let me introduce you to the Rev. Dr. Alexander MacBride.\\nDoctor, another guest we have been hoping for about this time,” was my\\nhost's cordial explanation to him of me. There remained the gentleman\\nwith his wife from New York, and to these I made my final bows. But I\\nhad not broken up the discourse.\\n\\n“We may be said to have met already.” Dr. MacBride had fixed upon me his\\nfull, mastering eye; and it occurred to me that if they had policemen\\nin heaven, he would be at least a centurion in the force. But he did not\\nmean to be unpleasant; it was only that in a mind full of matters less\\nworldly, pleasure was left out. “I observed your friend was a skilful\\nhorseman,” he continued. “I was saying to Judge Henry that I could wish\\nsuch skilful horsemen might ride to a church upon the Sabbath. A church,\\nthat is, of right doctrine, where they would have opportunity to hear\\nfrequent sermons.”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Judge Henry, “yes. It would be a good thing.”\\n\\nMrs. Henry, with some murmur about the kitchen, here went into the\\nhouse.\\n\\n“I was informed,” Dr. MacBride held the rest of us, “before undertaking\\nmy journey that I should find a desolate and mainly godless country. But\\nnobody gave me to understand that from Medicine Bow I was to drive three\\nhundred miles and pass no church of any faith.”\\n\\nThe Judge explained that there had been a few a long way to the right\\nand left of him. “Still,” he conceded, “you are quite right. But don't\\nforget that this is the newest part of a new world.”\\n\\n“Judge,” said his wife, coming to the door, “how can you keep them\\nstanding in the dust with your talking?”\\n\\nThis most efficiently did break up the discourse. As our little party,\\nwith the smiles and the polite holdings back of new acquaintanceship,\\nmoved into the house, the Judge detained me behind all of them long\\nenough to whisper dolorously, “He's going to stay a whole week.”\\n\\nI had hopes that he would not stay a whole week when I presently learned\\nof the crowded arrangements which our hosts, with many hospitable\\napologies, disclosed to us. They were delighted to have us, but they\\nhadn't foreseen that we should all be simultaneous. The foreman's house\\nhad been prepared for two of us, and did we mind? The two of us were\\nDr. MacBride and myself; and I expected him to mind. But I wronged him\\ngrossly. It would be much better, he assured Mrs. Henry, than straw in a\\nstable, which he had tried several times, and was quite ready for. So I\\nsaw that though he kept his vigorous body clean when he could, he cared\\nnothing for it in the face of his mission. How the foreman and his wife\\nrelished being turned out during a week for a missionary and myself\\nwas not my concern, although while he and I made ready for supper over\\nthere, it struck me as hard on them. The room with its two cots and\\nfurniture was as nice as possible; and we closed the door upon the\\nadjoining room, which, however, seemed also untenanted.\\n\\nMrs. Henry gave us a meal so good that I have remembered it, and her\\nhusband the Judge strove his best that we should eat it in merriment. He\\npoured out his anecdotes like wine, and we should have quickly warmed\\nto them; but Dr. MacBride sat among us, giving occasional heavy ha-ha's,\\nwhich produced, as Miss Molly Wood whispered to me, a “dreadfully\\ncavernous effect.” Was it his sermon, we wondered, that he was thinking\\nover? I told her of the copious sheaf of them I had seen him pull from\\nhis wallet over at the foreman's. “Goodness!” said she. “Then are we to\\nhear one every evening?” This I doubted; he had probably been picking\\none out suitable for the occasion. “Putting his best foot foremost,” was\\nher comment; “I suppose they have best feet, like the rest of us.” Then\\nshe grew delightfully sharp. “Do you know, when I first heard him I\\nthought his voice was hearty. But if you listen, you'll find it's\\nmerely militant. He never really meets you with it. He's off on his hill\\nwatching the battle-field the whole time.”\\n\\n“He will find a hardened pagan here.”\\n\\n“Judge Henry?”\\n\\n“Oh, no! The wild man you're taming brought you Kenilworth safe back.”\\n\\nShe was smooth. “Oh, as for taming him! But don't you find him\\nintelligent?”\\n\\nSuddenly I somehow knew that she didn't want to tame him. But what did\\nshe want to do? The thought of her had made him blush this afternoon. No\\nthought of him made her blush this evening.\\n\\nA great laugh from the rest of the company made me aware that the Judge\\nhad consummated his tale of the “Sole Survivor.”\\n\\n“And so,” he finished, “they all went off as mad as hops because\\nit hadn't been a massacre.” Mr. and Mrs. Ogden--they were the New\\nYorkers--gave this story much applause, and Dr. MacBride half a minute\\nlater laid his “ha-ha,” like a heavy stone, upon the gayety.\\n\\n“I'll never be able to stand seven sermons,” said Miss Wood to me.\\n\\n“Talking of massacres,”--I now hastened to address the already saddened\\ntable,--“I have recently escaped one myself.”\\n\\nThe Judge had come to an end of his powers. “Oh, tell us!” he implored.\\n\\n“Seriously, sir, I think we grazed pretty wet tragedy but your\\nextraordinary man brought us out into comedy safe and dry.”\\n\\nThis gave me their attention; and, from that afternoon in Dakota when I\\nhad first stepped aboard the caboose, I told them the whole tale of my\\nexperience: how I grew immediately aware that all was not right, by the\\nVirginian's kicking the cook off the train; how, as we journeyed, the\\ndark bubble of mutiny swelled hourly beneath my eyes; and how, when it\\nwas threatening I know not what explosion, the Virginian had pricked it\\nwith humor, so that it burst in nothing but harmless laughter.\\n\\nTheir eyes followed my narrative: the New Yorkers, because such events\\ndo not happen upon the shores of the Hudson; Mrs. Henry, because she was\\nmy hostess; Miss Wood followed for whatever her reasons were--I couldn't\\nsee her eyes; rather, I FELT her listening intently to the deeds and\\ndangers of the man she didn't care to tame. But it was the eyes of the\\nJudge and the missionary which I saw riveted upon me indeed until the\\nend; and they forthwith made plain their quite dissimilar opinions.\\n\\nJudge Henry struck the table lightly with his fist. “I knew it!” And he\\nleaned back in his chair with a face of contentment. He had trusted his\\nman, and his man had proved worthy.\\n\\n“Pardon me.” Dr. MacBride had a manner of saying “pardon me,” which\\nrendered forgiveness well-nigh impossible.\\n\\nThe Judge waited for him.\\n\\n“Am I to understand that these--a--cow-boys attempted to mutiny, and\\nwere discouraged in this attempt upon finding themselves less skilful at\\nlying than the man they had plotted to depose?”\\n\\nI began an answer. “It was other qualities, sir, that happened to be\\nrevealed and asserted by what you call his lying that--”\\n\\n“And what am I to call it, if it is not lying? A competition in deceit\\nin which, I admit, he out did them.\\n\\n“It's their way to--”\\n\\n“Pardon me. Their way to lie? They bow down to the greatest in this?”\\n\\n“Oh,” said Miss Wood in my ear, “give him up.”\\n\\nThe Judge took a turn. “We-ell, Doctor--” He seemed to stick here.\\n\\nMr. Ogden handsomely assisted him. “You've said the word yourself,\\nDoctor. It's the competition, don't you see? The trial of strength by no\\nmatter what test.”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Miss Wood, unexpectedly. “And it wasn't that George\\nWashington couldn't tell a lie. He just wouldn't. I'm sure if he'd\\nundertaken to he'd have told a much better one than Cornwall's.”\\n\\n“Ha-ha, madam! You draw an ingenious subtlety from your books.”\\n\\n“It's all plain to me,” Ogden pursued. “The men were morose. This\\nforeman was in the minority. He cajoled them into a bout of tall\\nstories, and told the tallest himself. And when they found they had\\nswallowed it whole--well, it would certainly take the starch out of me,”\\n he concluded. “I couldn't be a serious mutineer after that.”\\n\\nDr. MacBride now sounded his strongest bass. “Pardon me. I cannot accept\\nsuch a view, sir. There is a levity abroad in our land which I must\\ndeplore. No matter how leniently you may try to put it, in the end we\\nhave the spectacle of a struggle between men where lying decides the\\nsurvival of the fittest. Better, far better, if it was to come, that\\nthey had shot honest bullets. There are worse evils than war.”\\n\\nThe Doctor's eye glared righteously about him. None of us, I think,\\ntrembled; or, if we did, it was with emotions other than fear. Mrs.\\nHenry at once introduced the subject of trout-fishing, and thus happily\\nremoved us from the edge of whatever sort of precipice we seemed to have\\napproached; for Dr. MacBride had brought his rod. He dilated upon this\\nsport with fervor, and we assured him that the streams upon the west\\nslope of the Bow Leg Mountains would afford him plenty of it. Thus we\\nended our meal in carefully preserved amity.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXX. THE JUDGE IGNORES PARTICULARS\\n\\n\\n“Do you often have these visitations?” Ogden inquired of Judge Henry.\\nOur host was giving us whiskey in his office, and Dr. MacBride, while\\nwe smoked apart from the ladies, had repaired to his quarters in the\\nforeman's house previous to the service which he was shortly to hold.\\n\\nThe Judge laughed. “They come now and then through the year. I like the\\nbishop to come. And the men always like it. But I fear our friend will\\nscarcely please them so well.”\\n\\n“You don't mean they'll--”\\n\\n“Oh, no. They'll keep quiet. The fact is, they have a good deal better\\nmanners than he has, if he only knew it. They'll be able to bear him.\\nBut as for any good he'll do--”\\n\\n“I doubt if he knows a word of science,” said I, musing about the\\nDoctor.\\n\\n“Science! He doesn't know what Christianity is yet. I've entertained\\nmany guests, but none--The whole secret,” broke off Judge Henry, “lies\\nin the way you treat people. As soon as you treat men as your brothers,\\nthey are ready to acknowledge you--if you deserve it--as their superior.\\nThat's the whole bottom of Christianity, and that's what our missionary\\nwill never know.”\\n\\nThere was a somewhat heavy knock at the office door, and I think we all\\nfeared it was Dr. MacBride. But when the Judge opened, the Virginian was\\nstanding there in the darkness.\\n\\n“So!” The Judge opened the door wide. He was very hearty to the man he\\nhad trusted. “You're back at last.”\\n\\n“I came to repawt.”\\n\\nWhile they shook hands, Ogden nudged me. “That the fellow?” I nodded.\\n“Fellow who kicked the cook off the train?” I again nodded, and he\\nlooked at the Virginian, his eye and his stature.\\n\\nJudge Henry, properly democratic, now introduced him to Ogden.\\n\\nThe New Yorker also meant to be properly democratic. “You're the man\\nI've been hearing such a lot about.”\\n\\nBut familiarity is not equality. “Then I expect yu' have the advantage\\nof me, seh,” said the Virginian, very politely. “Shall I repawt\\nto-morro'?” His grave eyes were on the Judge again. Of me he had taken\\nno notice; he had come as an employee to see his employer.\\n\\n“Yes, yes; I'll want to hear about the cattle to-morrow. But step inside\\na moment now. There's a matter--” The Virginian stepped inside, and took\\noff his hat. “Sit down. You had trouble--I've heard something about it,”\\n the Judge went on.\\n\\nThe Virginian sat down, grave and graceful. But he held the brim of\\nhis hat all the while. He looked at Ogden and me, and then back at his\\nemployer. There was reluctance in his eye. I wondered if his employer\\ncould be going to make him tell his own exploits in the presence of\\nus outsiders; and there came into my memory the Bengal tiger at a\\ntrained-animal show I had once seen.\\n\\n“You had some trouble,” repeated the Judge.\\n\\n“Well, there was a time when they maybe wanted to have notions. They're\\ngood boys.” And he smiled a very little.\\n\\nContentment increased in the Judge's face. “Trampas a good boy too?”\\n\\nBut this time the Bengal tiger did not smile. He sat with his eye\\nfastened on his employer.\\n\\nThe Judge passed rather quickly on to his next point. “You've brought\\nthem all back, though, I understand, safe and sound, without a scratch?”\\n\\nThe Virginian looked down at his hat, then up again at the Judge,\\nmildly. “I had to part with my cook.”\\n\\nThere was no use; Ogden and myself exploded. Even upon the embarrassed\\nVirginian a large grin slowly forced itself. “I guess yu' know about\\nit,” he murmured. And he looked at me with a sort of reproach. He knew\\nit was I who had told tales out of school.\\n\\n“I only want to say,” said Ogden, conciliatingly, “that I know I\\ncouldn't have handled those men.”\\n\\nThe Virginian relented. “Yu' never tried, seh.”\\n\\nThe Judge had remained serious; but he showed himself plainly more and\\nmore contented. “Quite right,” he said. “You had to part with your\\ncook. When I put a man in charge, I put him in charge. I don't make\\nparticulars my business. They're to be always his. Do you understand?”\\n\\n“Thank yu'.” The Virginian understood that his employer was praising his\\nmanagement of the expedition. But I don't think he at all discerned--as\\nI did presently--that his employer had just been putting him to a\\nfurther test, had laid before him the temptation of complaining of a\\nfellow-workman and blowing his own trumpet, and was delighted with his\\nreticence. He made a movement to rise.\\n\\n“I haven't finished,” said the Judge. “I was coming to the matter.\\nThere's one particular--since I do happen to have been told. I fancy\\nTrampas has learned something he didn't expect.”\\n\\nThis time the Virginian evidently did not understand, any more than I\\ndid. One hand played with his hat, mechanically turning it round.\\n\\nThe Judge explained. “I mean about Roberts.”\\n\\nA pulse of triumph shot over the Southerner's face, turning it savage\\nfor that fleeting instant. He understood now, and was unable to suppress\\nthis much answer. But he was silent.\\n\\n“You see,” the Judge explained to me, “I was obliged to let Roberts, my\\nold foreman, go last week. His wife could not have stood another winter\\nhere, and a good position was offered to him near Los Angeles.”\\n\\nI did see. I saw a number of things. I saw why the foreman's house had\\nbeen empty to receive Dr. MacBride and me. And I saw that the Judge\\nhad been very clever indeed. For I had abstained from telling any tales\\nabout the present feeling between Trampas and the Virginian; but he had\\ndivined it. Well enough for him to say that “particulars” were something\\nhe let alone; he evidently kept a deep eye on the undercurrents at his\\nranch. He knew that in Roberts, Trampas had lost a powerful friend. And\\nthis was what I most saw, this final fact, that Trampas had no longer\\nany intervening shield. He and the Virginian stood indeed man to man.\\n\\n“And so,” the Judge continued speaking to me, “here I am at a very\\ninconvenient time without a foreman. Unless,” I caught the twinkle in\\nhis eyes before he turned to the Virginian, “unless you're willing to\\ntake the position yourself. Will you?”\\n\\nI saw the Southerner's hand grip his hat as he was turning it round. He\\nheld it still now, and his other hand found it and gradually crumpled\\nthe soft crown in. It meant everything to him: recognition, higher\\nstation, better fortune, a separate house of his own, and--perhaps--one\\nstep nearer to the woman he wanted. I don't know what words he might\\nhave said to the Judge had they been alone, but the Judge had chosen\\nto do it in our presence, the whole thing from beginning to end. The\\nVirginian sat with the damp coming out on his forehead, and his eyes\\ndropped from his employer's.\\n\\n“Thank yu',” was what he managed at last to say.\\n\\n“Well, now, I'm greatly relieved!” exclaimed the Judge, rising at once.\\nHe spoke with haste, and lightly. “That's excellent. I was in some thing\\nof a hole,” he said to Ogden and me; “and this gives me one thing less\\nto think of. Saves me a lot of particulars,” he jocosely added to the\\nVirginian, who was now also standing up. “Begin right off. Leave the\\nbunk house. The gentlemen won't mind your sleeping in your own house.”\\n\\nThus he dismissed his new foreman gayly. But the new foreman, when he\\ngot outside, turned back for one gruff word,--“I'll try to please yu'.”\\n That was all. He was gone in the darkness. But there was light enough\\nfor me, looking after him, to see him lay his hand on a shoulder-high\\ngate and vault it as if he had been the wind. Sounds of cheering came\\nto us a few moments later from the bunk house. Evidently he had “begun\\nright away,” as the Judge had directed. He had told his fortune to his\\nbrother cow-punchers, and this was their answer.\\n\\n“I wonder if Trampas is shouting too?” inquired Ogden.\\n\\n“Hm!” said the Judge. “That is one of the particulars I wash my hands\\nof.”\\n\\nI knew that he entirely meant it. I knew, once his decision taken of\\nappointing the Virginian his lieutenant for good and all, that, like a\\nwise commander-in-chief, he would trust his lieutenant to take care of\\nhis own business.\\n\\n“Well,” Ogden pursued with interest, “haven't you landed Trampas plump\\nat his mercy?”\\n\\nThe phrase tickled the Judge. “That is where I've landed him!” he\\ndeclared. “And here is Dr. MacBride.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXI. IN A STATE OF SIN\\n\\n\\nThunder sat imminent upon the missionary's brow. Many were to be at his\\nmercy soon. But for us he had sunshine still. “I am truly sorry to be\\nturning you upside down,” he said importantly. “But it seems the best\\nplace for my service.” He spoke of the tables pushed back and the chairs\\ngathered in the hall, where the storm would presently break upon the\\ncongregation. “Eight-thirty?” he inquired.\\n\\nThis was the hour appointed, and it was only twenty minutes off. We\\nthrew the unsmoked fractions of our cigars away, and returned to offer\\nour services to the ladies. This amused the ladies. They had done\\nwithout us. All was ready in the hall.\\n\\n“We got the cook to help us,” Mrs. Ogden told me, “so as not to\\ndisturb your cigars. In spite of the cow-boys, I still recognize my own\\ncountry.”\\n\\n“In the cook?” I rather densely asked.\\n\\n“Oh, no! I don't have a Chinaman. It's in the length of after-dinner\\ncigars.”\\n\\n“Had you been smoking,” I returned, “you would have found them short\\nthis evening.”\\n\\n“You make it worse,” said the lady; “we have had nothing but Dr. MacBride.”\\n\\n“We'll share him with you now,” I exclaimed.\\n\\n“Has he announced his text? I've got one for him,” said Molly Wood,\\njoining us. She stood on tiptoe and spoke it comically in our ears. “'I\\nsaid in my haste, All men are liars.'” This made us merry as we stood\\namong the chairs in the congested hall.\\n\\nI left the ladies, and sought the bunk house. I had heard the cheers,\\nbut I was curious also to see the men, and how they were taking it.\\nThere was but little for the eye. There was much noise in the room. They\\nwere getting ready to come to church,--brushing their hair, shaving, and\\nmaking themselves clean, amid talk occasionally profane and continuously\\ndiverting.\\n\\n“Well, I'm a Christian, anyway,” one declared.\\n\\n“I'm a Mormon, I guess,” said another.\\n\\n“I belong to the Knights of Pythias,” said a third.\\n\\n“I'm a Mohammedist,” said a fourth; “I hope I ain't goin' to hear\\nnothin' to shock me.”\\n\\nAnd they went on with their joking. But Trampas was out of the joking.\\nHe lay on his bed reading a newspaper, and took no pains to look\\npleasant. My eyes were considering him when the blithe Scipio came in.\\n\\n“Don't look so bashful,” said he. “There's only us girls here.”\\n\\nHe had been helping the Virginian move his belongings from the bunk\\nhouse over to the foreman's cabin. He himself was to occupy the\\nVirginian's old bed here. “And I hope sleepin' in it will bring me some\\nof his luck,” said Scipio. “Yu'd ought to've seen us when he told us in\\nhis quiet way. Well,” Scipio sighed a little, “it must feel good to have\\nyour friends glad about you.”\\n\\n“Especially Trampas,” said I. “The Judge knows about that,” I added.\\n\\n“Knows, does he? What's he say?” Scipio drew me quickly out of the bunk\\nhouse.\\n\\n“Says it's no business of his.”\\n\\n“Said nothing but that?” Scipio's curiosity seemed strangely intense.\\n“Made no suggestion? Not a thing?”\\n\\n“Not a thing. Said he didn't want to know and didn't care.”\\n\\n“How did he happen to hear about it?” snapped Scipio. “You told him!”\\n he immediately guessed. “He never would.” And Scipio jerked his thumb\\nat the Virginian, who appeared for a moment in the lighted window of the\\nnew quarters he was arranging. “He never would tell,” Scipio repeated.\\n“And so the Judge never made a suggestion to him,” he muttered, nodding\\nin the darkness. “So it's just his own notion. Just like him, too, come\\nto think of it. Only I didn't expect--well, I guess he could surprise me\\nany day he tried.”\\n\\n“You're surprising me now,” I said. “What's it all about?”\\n\\n“Oh, him and Trampas.”\\n\\n“What? Nothing surely happened yet?” I was as curious as Scipio had\\nbeen.\\n\\n“No, not yet. But there will.”\\n\\n“Great Heavens, man! when?”\\n\\n“Just as soon as Trampas makes the first move,” Scipio replied easily.\\n\\nI became dignified. Scipio had evidently been told things by the\\nVirginian.\\n\\n“Yes, I up and asked him plumb out,” Scipio answered. “I was liftin' his\\ntrunk in at the door, and I couldn't stand it no longer, and I asked him\\nplumb out. 'Yu've sure got Trampas where yu' want him.' That's what\\nI said. And he up and answered and told me. So I know.” At this point\\nScipio stopped; I was not to know.\\n\\n“I had no idea,” I said, “that your system held so much meanness.”\\n\\n“Oh, it ain't meanness!” And he laughed ecstatically.\\n\\n“What do you call it, then?”\\n\\n“He'd call it discretion,” said Scipio. Then he became serious. “It's\\ntoo blamed grand to tell yu'. I'll leave yu' to see it happen. Keep\\naround, that's all. Keep around. I pretty near wish I didn't know it\\nmyself.”\\n\\nWhat with my feelings at Scipio's discretion, and my human curiosity, I\\nwas not in that mood which best profits from a sermon. Yet even though\\nmy expectations had been cruelly left quivering in mid air, I was not\\nsure how much I really wanted to “keep around.” You will therefore\\nunderstand how Dr. MacBride was able to make a prayer and to read\\nScripture without my being conscious of a word that he had uttered. It\\nwas when I saw him opening the manuscript of his sermon that I suddenly\\nremembered I was sitting, so to speak, in church, and began once more to\\nthink of the preacher and his congregation. Our chairs were in the\\nfront line, of course; but, being next the wall, I could easily see\\nthe cow-boys behind me. They were perfectly decorous. If Mrs. Ogden had\\nlooked for pistols, daredevil attitudes, and so forth, she must have\\nbeen greatly disappointed. Except for their weather-beaten cheeks and\\neyes, they were simply American young men with mustaches and without,\\nand might have been sitting, say, in Danbury, Connecticut. Even Trampas\\nmerged quietly with the general placidity. The Virginian did not, to be\\nsure, look like Danbury, and his frame and his features showed out\\nof the mass; but his eyes were upon Dr. MacBride with a creamlike\\npropriety.\\n\\nOur missionary did not choose Miss Wood's text. He made his selection\\nfrom another of the Psalms; and when it came, I did not dare to look at\\nanybody; I was much nearer unseemly conduct than the cow-boys. Dr. MacBride\\ngave us his text sonorously, “'They are altogether become filthy;\\nThere is none of them that doeth good, no, not one.'” His eye showed us\\nplainly that present company was not excepted from this. He repeated the\\ntext once more, then, launching upon his discourse, gave none of us a\\nray of hope.\\n\\nI had heard it all often before; but preached to cow-boys it took on\\na new glare of untimeliness, of grotesque obsoleteness--as if some one\\nshould say, “Let me persuade you to admire woman,” and forthwith hold\\nout her bleached bones to you. The cow-boys were told that not only they\\ncould do no good, but that if they did contrive to, it would not help\\nthem. Nay, more: not only honest deeds availed them nothing, but even if\\nthey accepted this especial creed which was being explained to them as\\nnecessary for salvation, still it might not save them. Their sin was\\nindeed the cause of their damnation, yet, keeping from sin, they might\\nnevertheless be lost. It had all been settled for them not only before\\nthey were born, but before Adam was shaped. Having told them this, he\\ninvited them to glorify the Creator of the scheme. Even if damned, they\\nmust praise the person who had made them expressly for damnation. That\\nis what I heard him prove by logic to these cow-boys. Stone upon stone\\nhe built the black cellar of his theology, leaving out its beautiful\\npark and the sunshine of its garden. He did not tell them the splendor\\nof its past, the noble fortress for good that it had been, how its tonic\\nhad strengthened generations of their fathers. No; wrath he spoke of,\\nand never once of love. It was the bishop's way, I knew well, to hold\\ncow-boys by homely talk of their special hardships and temptations.\\nAnd when they fell he spoke to them of forgiveness and brought them\\nencouragement. But Dr. MacBride never thought once of the lives of\\nthese waifs. Like himself, like all mankind, they were invisible dots in\\ncreation; like him, they were to feel as nothing, to be swept up in the\\npotent heat of his faith. So he thrust out to them none of the sweet but\\nall the bitter of his creed, naked and stern as iron. Dogma was his all\\nin all, and poor humanity was nothing but flesh for its canons.\\n\\nThus to kill what chance he had for being of use seemed to me more\\ndeplorable than it did evidently to them. Their attention merely\\nwandered. Three hundred years ago they would have been frightened; but\\nnot in this electric day. I saw Scipio stifling a smile when it came to\\nthe doctrine of original sin. “We know of its truth,” said Dr. MacBride,\\n“from the severe troubles and distresses to which infants are liable,\\nand from death passing upon them before they are capable of sinning.”\\n Yet I knew he was a good man; and I also knew that if a missionary is to\\nbe tactless, he might almost as well be bad.\\n\\nI said their attention wandered, but I forgot the Virginian. At first\\nhis attitude might have been mere propriety. One can look respectfully\\nat a preacher and be internally breaking all the commandments. But even\\nwith the text I saw real attention light in the Virginian's eye. And\\nkeeping track of the concentration that grew on him with each minute\\nmade the sermon short for me. He missed nothing. Before the end his gaze\\nat the preacher had become swerveless. Was he convert or critic? Convert\\nwas incredible. Thus was an hour passed before I had thought of time.\\n\\nWhen it was over we took it variously. The preacher was genial and spoke\\nof having now broken ground for the lessons that he hoped to instil.\\nHe discoursed for a while about trout-fishing and about the rumored\\nuneasiness of the Indians northward where he was going. It was plain\\nthat his personal safety never gave him a thought. He soon bade us good\\nnight. The Ogdens shrugged their shoulders and were amused. That was\\ntheir way of taking it. Dr. MacBride sat too heavily on the Judge's\\nshoulders for him to shrug them. As a leading citizen in the Territory\\nhe kept open house for all comers. Policy and good nature made him bid\\nwelcome a wide variety of travellers. The cow-boy out of employment\\nfound bed and a meal for himself and his horse, and missionaries had\\nbefore now been well received at Sunk Creek Ranch.\\n\\n“I suppose I'll have to take him fishing,” said the Judge, ruefully.\\n\\n“Yes, my dear,” said his wife, “you will. And I shall have to make his\\ntea for six days.”\\n\\n“Otherwise,” Ogden suggested, “it might be reported that you were\\nenemies of religion.”\\n\\n“That's about it,” said the Judge. “I can get on with most people. But\\nelephants depress me.”\\n\\nSo we named the Doctor “Jumbo,” and I departed to my quarters.\\n\\nAt the bunk house, the comments were similar but more highly salted. The\\nmen were going to bed. In spite of their outward decorum at the service,\\nthey had not liked to be told that they were “altogether become filthy.”\\n It was easy to call names; they could do that themselves. And they\\nappealed to me, several speaking at once, like a concerted piece at\\nthe opera: “Say, do you believe babies go to hell?”--“Ah, of course he\\ndon't.”--“There ain't no hereafter, anyway.”--“Ain't there?”--“Who\\ntold yu'?”--“Same man as told the preacher we were all a sifted set of\\nsons-of-guns.”--“Well, I'm going to stay a Mormon.”--“Well, I'm going\\nto quit fleeing from temptation.”--“that's so! Better get it in the\\nneck after a good time than a poor one.” And so forth. Their wit was not\\nextreme, yet I should like Dr. MacBride to have heard it. One fellow put\\nhis natural soul pretty well into words, “If I happened to learn what\\nthey had predestinated me to do, I'd do the other thing, just to show\\n'em!”\\n\\nAnd Trampas? And the Virginian? They were out of it. The Virginian had\\ngone straight to his new abode. Trampas lay in his bed, not asleep, and\\nsullen as ever.\\n\\n“He ain't got religion this trip,” said Scipio to me.\\n\\n“Did his new foreman get it?” I asked.\\n\\n“Huh! It would spoil him. You keep around that's all. Keep around.”\\n\\nScipio was not to be probed; and I went, still baffled, to my repose.\\n\\nNo light burned in the cabin as I approached its door.\\n\\nThe Virginian's room was quiet and dark; and that Dr. MacBride slumbered\\nwas plainly audible to me, even before I entered. Go fishing with him!\\nI thought, as I undressed. And I selfishly decided that the Judge might\\nhave this privilege entirely to himself. Sleep came to me fairly\\nsoon, in spite of the Doctor. I was wakened from it by my bed's being\\njolted--not a pleasant thing that night. I must have started. And it\\nwas the quiet voice of the Virginian that told me he was sorry to have\\naccidentally disturbed me. This disturbed me a good deal more. But\\nhis steps did not go to the bunk house, as my sensational mind had\\nsuggested. He was not wearing much, and in the dimness he seemed taller\\nthan common. I next made out that he was bending over Dr. MacBride. The\\ndivine at last sprang upright.\\n\\n“I am armed,” he said. “Take care. Who are you?”\\n\\n“You can lay down your gun, seh. I feel like my spirit was going to bear\\nwitness. I feel like I might get an enlightening.”\\n\\nHe was using some of the missionary's own language. The baffling I had\\nbeen treated to by Scipio melted to nothing in this. Did living men\\npetrify, I should have changed to mineral between the sheets. The Doctor\\ngot out of bed, lighted his lamp, and found a book; and the two retired\\ninto the Virginian's room, where I could hear the exhortations as I\\nlay amazed. In time the Doctor returned, blew out his lamp, and settled\\nhimself. I had been very much awake, but was nearly gone to sleep again,\\nwhen the door creaked and the Virginian stood by the Doctor's side.\\n\\n“Are you awake, seh?”\\n\\n“What? What's that? What is it?”\\n\\n“Excuse me, seh. The enemy is winning on me. I'm feeling less inward\\nopposition to sin.”\\n\\nThe lamp was lighted, and I listened to some further exhortations.\\nThey must have taken half an hour. When the Doctor was in bed again, I\\nthought that I heard him sigh. This upset my composure in the dark;\\nbut I lay face downward in the pillow, and the Doctor was soon again\\nsnoring. I envied him for a while his faculty of easy sleep. But I must\\nhave dropped off myself; for it was the lamp in my eyes that now waked\\nme as he came back for the third time from the Virginian's room. Before\\nblowing the light out he looked at his watch, and thereupon I inquired\\nthe hour of him.\\n\\n“Three,” said he.\\n\\nI could not sleep any more now, and I lay watching the darkness.\\n\\n“I'm afeared to be alone!” said the Virginian's voice presently in the\\nnext room. “I'm afeared.” There was a short pause, and then he shouted\\nvery loud, “I'm losin' my desire afteh the sincere milk of the Word!”\\n\\n“What? What's that? What?” The Doctor's cot gave a great crack as he\\nstarted up listening, and I put my face deep in the pillow.\\n\\n“I'm afeared! I'm afeared! Sin has quit being bitter in my belly.”\\n\\n“Courage, my good man.” The Doctor was out of bed with his lamp again,\\nand the door shut behind him. Between them they made it long this time.\\nI saw the window become gray; then the corners of the furniture grow\\nvisible; and outside, the dry chorus of the blackbirds began to fill the\\ndawn. To these the sounds of chickens and impatient hoofs in the stable\\nwere added, and some cow wandered by loudly calling for her calf. Next,\\nsome one whistling passed near and grew distant. But although the cold\\nhue that I lay staring at through the window warmed and changed, the\\nDoctor continued working hard over his patient in the next room. Only a\\nword here and there was distinct; but it was plain from the Virginian's\\nfewer remarks that the sin in his belly was alarming him less. Yes, they\\nmade this time long. But it proved, indeed, the last one. And though\\nsome sort of catastrophe was bound to fall upon us, it was myself who\\nprecipitated the thing that did happen.\\n\\nDay was wholly come. I looked at my own watch, and it was six. I had\\nbeen about seven hours in my bed, and the Doctor had been about seven\\nhours out of his. The door opened, and he came in with his book and\\nlamp. He seemed to be shivering a little, and I saw him cast a longing\\neye at his couch. But the Virginian followed him even as he blew out\\nthe now quite superfluous light. They made a noticeable couple in their\\nunderclothes: the Virginian with his lean racehorse shanks running to\\na point at his ankle, and the Doctor with his stomach and his fat\\nsedentary calves.\\n\\n“You'll be going to breakfast and the ladies, seh, pretty soon,” said\\nthe Virginian, with a chastened voice. “But I'll worry through the day\\nsomehow without yu'. And to-night you can turn your wolf loose on me\\nagain.”\\n\\nOnce more it was no use. My face was deep in the pillow, but I made\\nsounds as of a hen who has laid an egg. It broke on the Doctor with a\\ntotal instantaneous smash, quite like an egg.\\n\\nHe tried to speak calmly. “This is a disgrace. An infamous disgrace.\\nNever in my life have I--” Words forsook him, and his face grew redder.\\n“Never in my life--” He stopped again, because, at the sight of him\\nbeing dignified in his red drawers, I was making the noise of a dozen\\nhens. It was suddenly too much for the Virginian. He hastened into his\\nroom, and there sank on the floor with his head in his hands. The Doctor\\nimmediately slammed the door upon him, and this rendered me easily fit\\nfor a lunatic asylum. I cried into my pillow, and wondered if the Doctor\\nwould come and kill me. But he took no notice of me whatever. I could\\nhear the Virginian's convulsions through the door, and also the Doctor\\nfuriously making his toilet within three feet of my head; and I lay\\nquite still with my face the other way, for I was really afraid to look\\nat him. When I heard him walk to the door in his boots, I ventured to\\npeep; and there he was, going out with his bag in his hand. As I still\\ncontinued to lie, weak and sore, and with a mind that had ceased all\\noperation, the Virginian's door opened. He was clean and dressed and\\ndecent, but the devil still sported in his eye. I have never seen a\\ncreature more irresistibly handsome.\\n\\nThen my mind worked again. “You've gone and done it,” said I. “He's\\npacked his valise. He'll not sleep here.”\\n\\nThe Virginian looked quickly out of the door. “Why, he's leavin' us!” he\\nexclaimed. “Drivin' away right now in his little old buggy!” He turned\\nto me, and our eyes met solemnly over this large fact. I thought that\\nI perceived the faintest tincture of dismay in the features of Judge\\nHenry's new, responsible, trusty foreman. This was the first act of his\\nadministration. Once again he looked out at the departing missionary.\\n“Well,” he vindictively stated, “I cert'nly ain't goin' to run afteh\\nhim.” And he looked at me again.\\n\\n“Do you suppose the Judge knows?” I inquired.\\n\\nHe shook his head. “The windo' shades is all down still oveh yondeh.”\\n He paused. “I don't care,” he stated, quite as if he had been ten years\\nold. Then he grinned guiltily. “I was mighty respectful to him all\\nnight.”\\n\\n“Oh, yes, respectful! Especially when you invited him to turn his wolf\\nloose.”\\n\\nThe Virginian gave a joyous gulp. He now came and sat down on the edge\\nof my bed. “I spoke awful good English to him most of the time,” said\\nhe. “I can, yu' know, when I cinch my attention tight on to it. Yes,\\nI cert'nly spoke a lot o' good English. I didn't understand some of it\\nmyself!”\\n\\nHe was now growing frankly pleased with his exploit. He had builded so\\nmuch better than he knew. He got up and looked out across the crystal\\nworld of light. “The Doctor is at one-mile crossing,” he said. “He'll\\nget breakfast at the N-lazy-Y.” Then he returned and sat again on my\\nbed, and began to give me his real heart. “I never set up for being\\nbetter than others. Not even to myself. My thoughts ain't apt to travel\\naround making comparisons. And I shouldn't wonder if my memory took\\nas much notice of the meannesses I have done as of--as of the other\\nactions. But to have to sit like a dumb lamb and let a stranger tell yu'\\nfor an hour that yu're a hawg and a swine, just after you have acted in\\na way which them that know the facts would call pretty near white--”\\n\\n“Trampas!” I could not help exclaiming.\\n\\nFor there are moments of insight when a guess amounts to knowledge.\\n\\n“Has Scipio told--”\\n\\n“No. Not a word. He wouldn't tell me.”\\n\\n“Well, yu' see, I arrived home hyeh this evenin' with several thoughts\\nworkin' and stirrin' inside me. And not one o' them thoughts was what\\nyu'd call Christian. I ain't the least little bit ashamed of 'em. I'm a\\nhuman. But after the Judge--well, yu' heard him. And so when I went away\\nfrom that talk and saw how positions was changed--”\\n\\nA step outside stopped him short. Nothing more could be read in his\\nface, for there was Trampas himself in the open door.\\n\\n“Good morning,” said Trampas, not looking at us. He spoke with the same\\ncool sullenness of yesterday.\\n\\nWe returned his greeting.\\n\\n“I believe I'm late in congratulating you on your promotion,” said he.\\n\\nThe Virginian consulted his watch. “It's only half afteh six,” he\\nreturned.\\n\\nTrampas's sullenness deepened. “Any man is to be congratulated on\\ngetting a rise, I expect.”\\n\\nThis time the Virginian let him have it. “Cert'nly. And I ain't\\nforgetting how much I owe mine to you.”\\n\\nTrampas would have liked to let himself go. “I've not come here for any\\nforgiveness,” he sneered.\\n\\n“When did yu' feel yu' needed any?” The Virginian was impregnable.\\n\\nTrampas seemed to feel how little he was gaining this way. He came out\\nstraight now. “Oh, I haven't any Judge behind me, I know. I heard you'd\\nbe paying the boys this morning, and I've come for my time.”\\n\\n“You're thinking of leaving us?” asked the new foreman. “What's your\\ndissatisfaction?”\\n\\n“Oh, I'm not needing anybody back of me. I'll get along by myself.” It\\nwas thus he revealed his expectation of being dismissed by his enemy.\\n\\nThis would have knocked any meditated generosity out of my heart. But\\nI was not the Virginian. He shifted his legs, leaned back a little, and\\nlaughed. “Go back to your job, Trampas, if that's all your complaint.\\nYou're right about me being in luck. But maybe there's two of us in\\nluck.”\\n\\nIt was this that Scipio had preferred me to see with my own eyes. The\\nfight was between man and man no longer. The case could not be one of\\nforgiveness; but the Virginian would not use his official position to\\ncrush his subordinate.\\n\\nTrampas departed with something muttered that I did not hear, and the\\nVirginian closed intimate conversation by saying, “You'll be late for\\nbreakfast.” With that he also took himself away.\\n\\nThe ladies were inclined to be scandalized, but not the Judge. When my\\nwhole story was done, he brought his fist down on the table, and not\\nlightly this time. “I'd make him lieutenant general if the ranch offered\\nthat position!” he declared.\\n\\nMiss Molly Wood said nothing at the time. But in the afternoon, by her\\nwish, she went fishing, with the Virginian deputed to escort her. I\\nrode with them, for a while. I was not going to continue a third in that\\nparty; the Virginian was too becomingly dressed, and I saw KENILWORTH\\npeeping out of his pocket. I meant to be fishing by myself when that\\nvolume was returned.\\n\\nBut Miss Wood talked with skilful openness as we rode. “I've heard all\\nabout you and Dr. MacBride,” she said. “How could you do it, when the\\nJudge places such confidence in you?”\\n\\nHe looked pleased. “I reckon,” he said, “I couldn't be so good if I\\nwasn't bad onced in a while.”\\n\\n“Why, there's a skunk,” said I, noticing the pretty little animal\\ntrotting in front of us at the edge of the thickets.\\n\\n“Oh, where is it? Don't let me see it!” screamed Molly. And at this\\ndeeply feminine remark, the Virginian looked at her with such a smile\\nthat, had I been a woman, it would have made me his to do what he\\npleased with on the spot.\\n\\nUpon the lady, however, it seemed to make less impression. Or rather, I\\nhad better say, whatever were her feelings, she very naturally made no\\ndisplay of them, and contrived not to be aware of that expression which\\nhad passed over the Virginian's face.\\n\\nIt was later that these few words reached me while I was fishing alone:\\n“Have you anything different to tell me yet?” I heard him say.\\n\\n“Yes; I have.” She spoke in accents light and well intrenched. “I wish\\nto say that I have never liked any man better than you. But I expect\\nto!”\\n\\nHe must have drawn small comfort from such an answer as that. But he\\nlaughed out indomitably: “Don't yu' go betting on any such expectation!”\\n And then their words ceased to be distinct, and it was only their two\\nvoices that I heard wandering among the windings of the stream.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXII. “WHAT IS A RUSTLER?”\\n\\n\\nWe all know what birds of a feather do. And it may be safely surmised\\nthat if a bird of any particular feather has been for a long while\\nunable to see other birds of its kind, it will flock with them all the\\nmore assiduously when they happen to alight in its vicinity.\\n\\nNow the Ogdens were birds of Molly's feather. They wore Eastern, and not\\nWestern, plumage, and their song was a different song from that which\\nthe Bear Creek birds sang. To be sure, the piping of little George\\nTaylor was full of hopeful interest; and many other strains, both\\nstriking and melodious, were lifted in Cattle Land, and had given\\npleasure to Molly's ear. But although Indians, and bears, and mavericks,\\nmake worthy themes for song, these are not the only songs in the world.\\nTherefore the Eastern warblings of the Ogdens sounded doubly sweet to\\nMolly Wood. Such words as Newport, Bar Harbor, and Tiffany's thrilled\\nher exceedingly. It made no difference that she herself had never been\\nto Newport or Bar Harbor, and had visited Tiffany's more often to admire\\nthan to purchase. On the contrary, this rather added a dazzle to the\\nmusic of the Ogdens. And Molly, whose Eastern song had been silent in\\nthis strange land, began to chirp it again during the visit that she\\nmade at the Sunk Creek Ranch.\\n\\nThus the Virginian's cause by no means prospered at this time. His\\nforces were scattered, while Molly's were concentrated. The girl was\\nnot at that point where absence makes the heart grow fonder. While the\\nVirginian was trundling his long, responsible miles in the caboose,\\ndelivering the cattle at Chicago, vanquishing Trampas along the\\nYellowstone, she had regained herself.\\n\\nThus it was that she could tell him so easily during those first hours\\nthat they were alone after his return, “I expect to like another man\\nbetter than you.”\\n\\nAbsence had recruited her. And then the Ogdens had reenforced her. They\\nbrought the East back powerfully to her memory, and her thoughts filled\\nwith it. They did not dream that they were assisting in any battle. No\\none ever had more unconscious allies than did Molly at that time. But\\nshe used them consciously, or almost consciously. She frequented them;\\nshe spoke of Eastern matters; she found that she had acquaintances whom\\nthe Ogdens also knew, and she often brought them into the conversation.\\nFor it may be said, I think, that she was fighting a battle--nay, a\\ncampaign. And perhaps this was a hopeful sign for the Virginian (had he\\nbut known it), that the girl resorted to allies. She surrounded herself,\\nshe steeped herself, with the East, to have, as it were, a sort of\\ncounteractant against the spell of the black-haired horse man.\\n\\nAnd his forces were, as I have said, scattered. For his promotion gave\\nhim no more time for love-making. He was foreman now. He had said to\\nJudge Henry, “I'll try to please yu'.” And after the throb of emotion\\nwhich these words had both concealed and conveyed, there came to him\\nthat sort of intention to win which amounts to a certainty. Yes, he\\nwould please Judge Henry!\\n\\nHe did not know how much he had already pleased him. He did not know\\nthat the Judge was humorously undecided which of his new foreman's first\\nacts had the more delighted him: his performance with the missionary, or\\nhis magnanimity to Trampas.\\n\\n“Good feeling is a great thing in any one,” the Judge would say; “but I\\nlike to know that my foreman has so much sense.”\\n\\n“I am personally very grateful to him,” said Mrs. Henry.\\n\\nAnd indeed so was the whole company. To be afflicted with Dr. MacBride\\nfor one night instead of six was a great liberation.\\n\\nBut the Virginian never saw his sweetheart alone again; while she was at\\nthe Sunk Creek Ranch, his duties called him away so much that there was\\nno chance for him. Worse still, that habit of birds of a feather brought\\nabout a separation more considerable. She arranged to go East with the\\nOgdens. It was so good an opportunity to travel with friends, instead of\\nmaking the journey alone!\\n\\nMolly's term of ministration at the schoolhouse had so pleased Bear\\nCreek that she was warmly urged to take a holiday. School could afford\\nto begin a little late. Accordingly, she departed.\\n\\nThe Virginian hid his sore heart from her during the moment of farewell\\nthat they had.\\n\\n“No, I'll not want any more books,” he said, “till yu' come back.” And\\nthen he made cheerfulness. “It's just the other way round!” said he.\\n\\n“What is the other way round?”\\n\\n“Why, last time it was me that went travelling, and you that stayed\\nbehind.”\\n\\n“So it was!” And here she gave him a last scratch. “But you'll be busier\\nthan ever,” she said; “no spare time to grieve about me!”\\n\\nShe could wound him, and she knew it. Nobody else could. That is why she\\ndid it.\\n\\nBut he gave her something to remember, too.\\n\\n“Next time,” he said, “neither of us will stay behind. We'll both go\\ntogether.”\\n\\nAnd with these words he gave her no laughing glance. It was a look that\\nmingled with the words; so that now and again in the train, both came\\nback to her, and she sat pensive, drawing near to Bennington and hearing\\nhis voice and seeing his eyes.\\n\\nHow is it that this girl could cry at having to tell Sam Bannett she\\ncould not think of him, and then treat another lover as she treated the\\nVirginian? I cannot tell you, having never (as I said before) been a\\nwoman myself.\\n\\nBennington opened its arms to its venturesome daughter. Much was made\\nof Molly Wood. Old faces and old places welcomed her. Fatted calves of\\nvarying dimensions made their appearance. And although the fatted calf\\nis an animal that can assume more divergent shapes than any other known\\ncreature,--being sometimes champagne and partridges, and again cake and\\ncurrant wine,--through each disguise you can always identify the same\\ncalf. The girl from Bear Creek met it at every turn.\\n\\nThe Bannetts at Hoosic Falls offered a large specimen to Molly--a dinner\\n(perhaps I should say a banquet) of twenty-four. And Sam Bannett of\\ncourse took her to drive more than once.\\n\\n“I want to see the Hoosic Bridge,” she would say. And when they reached\\nthat well-remembered point, “How lovely it is!” she exclaimed. And as\\nshe gazed at the view up and down the valley, she would grow pensive.\\n“How natural the church looks,” she continued. And then, having crossed\\nboth bridges, “Oh, there's the dear old lodge gate!” Or again, while\\nthey drove up the valley of the little Hoosic: “I had forgotten it was\\nso nice and lonely. But after all, no woods are so interesting as\\nthose where you might possibly see a bear or an elk.” And upon another\\noccasion, after a cry of enthusiasm at the view from the top of Mount\\nAnthony, “It's lovely, lovely, lovely,” she said, with diminishing\\ncadence, ending in pensiveness once more. “Do you see that little bit\\njust there? No, not where the trees are--that bare spot that looks\\nbrown and warm in the sun. With a little sagebrush, that spot would look\\nsomething like a place I know on Bear Creek. Only of course you don't\\nget the clear air here.”\\n\\n“I don't forget you,” said Sam. “Do you remember me? Or is it out of\\nsight out of mind?”\\n\\nAnd with this beginning he renewed his suit. She told him that she\\nforgot no one; that she should return always, lest they might forget\\nher.\\n\\n“Return always!” he exclaimed. “You talk as if your anchor was\\ndragging.”\\n\\nWas it? At all events, Sam failed in his suit.\\n\\nOver in the house at Dunbarton, the old lady held Molly's hand and\\nlooked a long while at her. “You have changed very much,” she said\\nfinally.\\n\\n“I am a year older,” said the girl.\\n\\n“Pshaw, my dear!” said the great-aunt. “Who is he?”\\n\\n“Nobody!” cried Molly, with indignation.\\n\\n“Then you shouldn't answer so loud,” said the great-aunt.\\n\\nThe girl suddenly hid her face. “I don't believe I can love any one,”\\n she said, “except myself.”\\n\\nAnd then that old lady, who in her day had made her courtesy to\\nLafayette, began to stroke her niece's buried head, because she more\\nthan half understood. And understanding thus much, she asked no prying\\nquestions, but thought of the days of her own youth, and only spoke a\\nlittle quiet love and confidence to Molly.\\n\\n“I am an old, old woman,” she said. “But I haven't forgotten about it.\\nThey objected to him because he had no fortune. But he was brave and\\nhandsome, and I loved him, my dear. Only I ought to have loved him more.\\nI gave him my promise to think about it. And he and his ship were lost.”\\n The great-aunt's voice had become very soft and low, and she spoke with\\nmany pauses. “So then I knew. If I had--if--perhaps I should have lost\\nhim; but it would have been after--ah, well! So long as you can help\\nit, never marry! But when you cannot help it a moment longer, then\\nlisten to nothing but that; for, my dear, I know your choice would be\\nworthy of the Starks. And now--let me see his picture.”\\n\\n“Why, aunty!” said Molly.\\n\\n“Well, I won't pretend to be supernatural,” said the aunt, “but I\\nthought you kept one back when you were showing us those Western views\\nlast night.”\\n\\nNow this was the precise truth. Molly had brought a number of\\nphotographs from Wyoming to show to her friends at home. These, however,\\nwith one exception, were not portraits. They were views of scenery and\\nof cattle round-ups, and other scenes characteristic of ranch life. Of\\nyoung men she had in her possession several photographs, and all but one\\nof these she had left behind her. Her aunt's penetration had in a way\\nmesmerized the girl; she rose obediently and sought that picture of\\nthe Virginian. It was full length, displaying him in all his cow-boy\\ntrappings,--the leathern chaps, the belt and pistol, and in his hand a\\ncoil of rope.\\n\\nNot one of her family had seen it, or suspected its existence. She now\\nbrought it downstairs and placed it in her aunt's hand.\\n\\n“Mercy!” cried the old lady.\\n\\nMolly was silent, but her eye grew warlike.\\n\\n“Is that the way--” began the aunt. “Mercy!” she murmured; and she sat\\nstaring at the picture.\\n\\nMolly remained silent.\\n\\nHer aunt looked slowly up at her. “Has a man like that presumed--”\\n\\n“He's not a bit like that. Yes, he's exactly like that,” said Molly. And\\nshe would have snatched the photograph away, but her aunt retained it.\\n\\n“Well,” she said, “I suppose there are days when he does not kill\\npeople.”\\n\\n“He never killed anybody!” And Molly laughed.\\n\\n“Are you seriously--” said the old lady.\\n\\n“I almost might--at times. He is perfectly splendid.”\\n\\n“My dear, you have fallen in love with his clothes.”\\n\\n“It's not his clothes. And I'm not in love. He often wears others. He\\nwears a white collar like anybody.”\\n\\n“Then that would be a more suitable way to be photographed, I think. He\\ncouldn't go round like that here. I could not receive him myself.”\\n\\n“He'd never think of such a thing. Why, you talk as if he were a\\nsavage.”\\n\\nThe old lady studied the picture closely for a minute. “I think it is a\\ngood face,” she finally remarked. “Is the fellow as handsome as that, my\\ndear?”\\n\\nMore so, Molly thought. And who was he, and what were his prospects?\\nwere the aunt's next inquiries. She shook her head at the answers which\\nshe received; and she also shook her head over her niece's emphatic\\ndenial that her heart was lost to this man. But when their parting came,\\nthe old lady said: “God bless you and keep you, my dear. I'll not try to\\nmanage you. They managed me--” A sigh spoke the rest of this sentence.\\n“But I'm not worried about you--at least, not very much. You have never\\ndone anything that was not worthy of the Starks. And if you're going\\nto take him, do it before I die so that I can bid him welcome for your\\nsake. God bless you, my dear.”\\n\\nAnd after the girl had gone back to Bennington, the great-aunt had this\\nthought: “She is like us all. She wants a man that is a man.” Nor did\\nthe old lady breathe her knowledge to any member of the family. For she\\nwas a loyal spirit, and her girl's confidence was sacred to her.\\n\\n“Besides,” she reflected, “if even I can do nothing with her, what a\\nmess THEY'D make of it! We should hear of her elopement next.”\\n\\nSo Molly's immediate family never saw that photograph, and never heard\\na word from her upon this subject. But on the day that she left for Bear\\nCreek, as they sat missing her and discussing her visit in the evening,\\nMrs. Bell observed: “Mother, how did you think she was?”--“I never saw\\nher better, Sarah. That horrible place seems to agree with her.”--“Oh,\\nyes, agree. It seemed to me--“--“Well?”--“Oh, just somehow that she\\nwas thinking.”--“Thinking?”--“Well, I believe she has something on her\\nmind.”--“You mean a man,” said Andrew Bell.--“A man, Andrew?”--“Yes,\\nMrs. Wood, that's what Sarah always means.”\\n\\nIt may be mentioned that Sarah's surmises did not greatly contribute to\\nher mother's happiness. And rumor is so strange a thing that presently\\nfrom the malicious outside air came a vague and dreadful word--one of\\nthose words that cannot be traced to its source. Somebody said to Andrew\\nBell that they heard Miss Molly Wood was engaged to marry a RUSTLER.\\n\\n“Heavens, Andrew!” said his wife; “what is a rustler?”\\n\\nIt was not in any dictionary, and current translations of it were\\ninconsistent. A man at Hoosic Falls said that he had passed through\\nCheyenne, and heard the term applied in a complimentary way to people\\nwho were alive and pushing. Another man had always supposed it meant\\nsome kind of horse. But the most alarming version of all was that a\\nrustler was a cattle thief.\\n\\nNow the truth is that all these meanings were right. The word ran a sort\\nof progress in the cattle country, gathering many meanings as it went.\\nIt gathered more, however, in Bennington. In a very few days, gossip had\\nit that Molly was engaged to a gambler, a gold miner, an escaped stage\\nrobber, and a Mexican bandit; while Mrs. Flynt feared she had married a\\nMormon.\\n\\nAlong Bear Creek, however, Molly and her “rustler” took a ride soon\\nafter her return. They were neither married nor engaged, and she was\\ntelling him about Vermont.\\n\\n“I never was there,” said he. “Never happened to strike in that\\ndirection.”\\n\\n“What decided your direction?”\\n\\n“Oh, looking for chances. I reckon I must have been more ambitious than\\nmy brothers--or more restless. They stayed around on farms. But I got\\nout. When I went back again six years afterward, I was twenty. They was\\ntalking about the same old things. Men of twenty-five and thirty--yet\\njust sittin' and talkin' about the same old things. I told my mother\\nabout what I'd seen here and there, and she liked it, right to her\\ndeath. But the others--well, when I found this whole world was hawgs and\\nturkeys to them, with a little gunnin' afteh small game throwed in, I\\nput on my hat one mawnin' and told 'em maybe when I was fifty I'd look\\nin on 'em again to see if they'd got any new subjects. But they'll\\nnever. My brothers don't seem to want chances.”\\n\\n“You have lost a good many yourself,” said Molly.\\n\\n“That's correct.”\\n\\n“And yet,” said she, “sometimes I think you know a great deal more than\\nI ever shall.”\\n\\n“Why, of course I do,” said he, quite simply. “I have earned my living\\nsince I was fourteen. And that's from old Mexico to British Columbia.\\nI have never stolen or begged a cent. I'd not want yu' to know what I\\nknow.”\\n\\nShe was looking at him, half listening and half thinking of her\\ngreat-aunt.\\n\\n“I am not losing chances any more,” he continued. “And you are the best\\nI've got.”\\n\\nShe was not sorry to have Georgie Taylor come galloping along at this\\nmoment and join them. But the Virginian swore profanely under his\\nbreath. And on this ride nothing more happened.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXIII. VARIOUS POINTS\\n\\n\\nLove had been snowbound for many weeks. Before this imprisonment its\\ncourse had run neither smooth nor rough, so far as eye could see; it\\nhad run either not at all, or, as an undercurrent, deep out of sight. In\\ntheir rides, in their talks, love had been dumb, as to spoken words at\\nleast; for the Virginian had set himself a heavy task of silence and of\\npatience. Then, where winter barred his visits to Bear Creek, and there\\nwas for the while no ranch work or responsibility to fill his thoughts\\nand blood with action, he set himself a task much lighter. Often,\\ninstead of Shakespeare and fiction, school books lay open on his cabin\\ntable; and penmanship and spelling helped the hours to pass. Many sheets\\nof paper did he fill with various exercises, and Mrs. Henry gave him her\\nassistance in advice and corrections.\\n\\n“I shall presently be in love with him myself,” she told the Judge. “And\\nit's time for you to become anxious.”\\n\\n“I am perfectly safe,” he retorted. “There's only one woman for him any\\nmore.”\\n\\n“She is not good enough for him,” declared Mrs. Henry. “But he'll never\\nsee that.”\\n\\nSo the snow fell, the world froze, and the spelling-books and exercises\\nwent on. But this was not the only case of education which was\\nprogressing at the Sunk Creek Ranch while love was snowbound.\\n\\nOne morning Scipio le Moyne entered the Virginian's sitting room--that\\napartment where Dr. MacBride had wrestled with sin so courageously all\\nnight.\\n\\nThe Virginian sat at his desk. Open books lay around him; a\\nhalf-finished piece of writing was beneath his fist; his fingers were\\ncoated with ink. Education enveloped him, it may be said. But there was\\nnone in his eye. That was upon the window, looking far across the cold\\nplain.\\n\\nThe foreman did not move when Scipio came in, and this humorous spirit\\nsmiled to himself. “It's Bear Creek he's havin' a vision of,” he\\nconcluded. But he knew instantly that this was not so. The Virginian\\nwas looking at something real, and Scipio went to the window to see for\\nhimself.\\n\\n“Well,” he said, having seen, “when is he going to leave us?”\\n\\nThe foreman continued looking at two horsemen riding together. Their\\nshapes, small in the distance, showed black against the universal\\nwhiteness.\\n\\n“When d' yu' figure he'll leave us?” repeated Scipio.\\n\\n“He,” murmured the Virginian, always watching the distant horsemen; and\\nagain, “he.”\\n\\nScipio sprawled down, familiarly, across a chair. He and the Virginian\\nhad come to know each other very well since that first meeting at\\nMedora. They were birds many of whose feathers were the same, and the\\nVirginian often talked to Scipio without reserve. Consequently, Scipio\\nnow understood those two syllables that the Virginian had pronounced\\nprecisely as though the sentences which lay between them had been fully\\nexpressed.\\n\\n“Hm,” he remarked. “Well, one will be a gain, and the other won't be no\\nloss.”\\n\\n“Poor Shorty!” said the Virginian. “Poor fool!”\\n\\nScipio was less compassionate. “No,” he persisted, “I ain't sorry for\\nhim. Any man old enough to have hair on his face ought to see through\\nTrampas.”\\n\\nThe Virginian looked out of the window again, and watched Shorty and\\nTrampas as they rode in the distance. “Shorty is kind to animals,” he\\nsaid. “He has gentled that hawss Pedro he bought with his first money.\\nGentled him wonderful. When a man is kind to dumb animals, I always say\\nhe had got some good in him.”\\n\\n“Yes,” Scipio reluctantly admitted. “Yes. But I always did hate a fool.”\\n\\n“This hyeh is a mighty cruel country,” pursued the Virginian. “To\\nanimals that is. Think of it! Think what we do to hundreds an' thousands\\nof little calves! Throw 'em down, brand 'em, cut 'em, ear mark 'em, turn\\n'em loose, and on to the next. It has got to be, of course. But I say\\nthis. If a man can go jammin' hot irons on to little calves and slicin'\\npieces off 'em with his knife, and live along, keepin' a kindness for\\nanimals in his heart, he has got some good in him. And that's what\\nShorty has got. But he is lettin' Trampas get a hold of him, and both of\\nthem will leave us.” And the Virginian looked out across the huge winter\\nwhiteness again. But the riders had now vanished behind some foot-hills.\\n\\nScipio sat silent. He had never put these thoughts about men and animals\\nto himself, and when they were put to him, he saw that they were true.\\n\\n“Queer,” he observed finally.\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“Everything.”\\n\\n“Nothing's queer,” stated the Virginian, “except marriage and lightning.\\nThem two occurrences can still give me a sensation of surprise.”\\n\\n“All the same it is queer,” Scipio insisted\\n\\n“Well, let her go at me.”\\n\\n“Why, Trampas. He done you dirt. You pass that over. You could have\\nfired him, but you let him stay and keep his job. That's goodness. And\\nbadness is resultin' from it, straight. Badness right from goodness.”\\n\\n“You're off the trail a whole lot,” said the Virginian.\\n\\n“Which side am I off, then?”\\n\\n“North, south, east, and west. First point. I didn't expect to do\\nTrampas any good by not killin' him, which I came pretty near doin'\\nthree times. Nor I didn't expect to do Trampas any good by lettin' him\\nkeep his job. But I am foreman of this ranch. And I can sit and tell all\\nmen to their face: 'I was above that meanness.' Point two: it ain't any\\nGOODNESS, it is TRAMPAS that badness has resulted from. Put him anywhere\\nand it will be the same. Put him under my eye, and I can follow his\\nmoves a little, anyway. You have noticed, maybe, that since you and I\\nrun on to that dead Polled Angus cow, that was still warm when we got\\nto her, we have found no more cows dead of sudden death. We came mighty\\nclose to catchin' whoever it was that killed that cow and ran her calf\\noff to his own bunch. He wasn't ten minutes ahead of us. We can prove\\nnothin'; and he knows that just as well as we do. But our cows have all\\nquit dyin' of sudden death. And Trampas he's gettin' ready for a change\\nof residence. As soon as all the outfits begin hirin' new hands in the\\nspring, Trampas will leave us and take a job with some of them. And\\nmaybe our cows'll commence gettin' killed again, and we'll have to take\\nsteps that will be more emphatic--maybe.”\\n\\nScipio meditated. “I wonder what killin' a man feels like?” he said.\\n\\n“Why, nothing to bother yu'--when he'd ought to have been killed. Next\\npoint: Trampas he'll take Shorty with him, which is certainly bad for\\nShorty. But it's me that has kept Shorty out of harm's way this long. If\\nI had fired Trampas, he'd have worked Shorty into dissatisfaction that\\nmuch sooner.”\\n\\nScipio meditated again. “I knowed Trampas would pull his freight,” he\\nsaid. “But I didn't think of Shorty. What makes you think it?”\\n\\n“He asked me for a raise.”\\n\\n“He ain't worth the pay he's getting now.”\\n\\n“Trampas has told him different.”\\n\\n“When a man ain't got no ideas of his own,” said Scipio, “he'd ought to\\nbe kind o' careful who he borrows 'em from.”\\n\\n“That's mighty correct,” said the Virginian. “Poor Shorty! He has told\\nme about his life. It is sorrowful. And he will never get wise. It was\\ntoo late for him to get wise when he was born. D' yu' know why he's\\nafter higher wages? He sends most all his money East.”\\n\\n“I don't see what Trampas wants him for,” said Scipio.\\n\\n“Oh, a handy tool some day.”\\n\\n“Not very handy,” said Scipio.\\n\\n“Well, Trampas is aimin' to train him. Yu' see, supposin' yu' were\\nfiguring to turn professional thief--yu'd be lookin' around for a nice\\nyoung trustful accomplice to take all the punishment and let you take\\nthe rest.”\\n\\n“No such thing!” cried Scipio, angrily. “I'm no shirker.” And then,\\nperceiving the Virginian's expression, he broke out laughing. “Well,” he\\nexclaimed, “yu' fooled me that time.”\\n\\n“Looks that way. But I do mean it about Trampas.”\\n\\nPresently Scipio rose, and noticed the half-finished exercise upon the\\nVirginian's desk. “Trampas is a rolling stone,” he said.\\n\\n“A rolling piece of mud,” corrected the Virginian.\\n\\n“Mud! That's right. I'm a rolling stone. Sometimes I'd most like to quit\\nbeing.”\\n\\n“That's easy done,” said the Virginian.\\n\\n“No doubt, when yu've found the moss yu' want to gather.” As Scipio\\nglanced at the school books again, a sparkle lurked in his bleached blue\\neye. “I can cipher some,” he said. “But I expect I've got my own notions\\nabout spelling.”\\n\\n“I retain a few private ideas that way myself,” remarked the Virginian,\\ninnocently; and Scipio's sparkle gathered light.\\n\\n“As to my geography,” he pursued, “that's away out loose in the brush.\\nIs Bennington the capital of Vermont? And how d' yu' spell bridegroom?”\\n\\n“Last point!” shouted the Virginian, letting a book fly after him:\\n“don't let badness and goodness worry yu', for yu'll never be a judge of\\nthem.”\\n\\nBut Scipio had dodged the book, and was gone. As he went his way, he\\nsaid to himself, “All the same, it must pay to fall regular in love.”\\n At the bunk house that afternoon it was observed that he was unusually\\nsilent. His exit from the foreman's cabin had let in a breath of winter\\nso chill that the Virginian went to see his thermometer, a Christmas\\npresent from Mrs. Henry. It registered twenty below zero. After reviving\\nthe fire to a white blaze, the foreman sat thinking over the story\\nof Shorty: what its useless, feeble past had been; what would be its\\nuseless, feeble future. He shook his head over the sombre question,\\nWas there any way out for Shorty? “It may be,” he reflected, “that them\\nwhose pleasure brings yu' into this world owes yu' a living. But that\\ndon't make the world responsible. The world did not beget you. I reckon\\nman helps them that help themselves. As for the universe, it looks like\\nit did too wholesale a business to turn out an article up to standard\\nevery clip. Yes, it is sorrowful. For Shorty is kind to his hawss.”\\n\\nIn the evening the Virginian brought Shorty into his room. He usually\\nknew what he had to say, usually found it easy to arrange his thoughts;\\nand after such arranging the words came of themselves. But as he looked\\nat Shorty, this did not happen to him. There was not a line of badness\\nin the face; yet also there was not a line of strength; no promise in\\neye, or nose, or chin; the whole thing melted to a stubby, featureless\\nmediocrity. It was a countenance like thousands; and hopelessness filled\\nthe Virginian as he looked at this lost dog, and his dull, wistful eyes.\\n\\nBut some beginning must be made.\\n\\n“I wonder what the thermometer has got to be,” he said. “Yu' can see it,\\nif yu'll hold the lamp to that right side of the window.”\\n\\nShorty held the lamp. “I never used any,” he said, looking out at the\\ninstrument, nevertheless.\\n\\nThe Virginian had forgotten that Shorty could not read. So he looked\\nout of the window himself, and found that it was twenty-two below zero.\\n“This is pretty good tobacco,” he remarked; and Shorty helped himself,\\nand filled his pipe.\\n\\n“I had to rub my left ear with snow to-day,” said he. “I was just in\\ntime.”\\n\\n“I thought it looked pretty freezy out where yu' was riding,” said the\\nforeman.\\n\\nThe lost dog's eyes showed plain astonishment. “We didn't see you out\\nthere,” said he.\\n\\n“Well,” said the foreman, “it'll soon not be freezing any more; and then\\nwe'll all be warm enough with work. Everybody will be working all over\\nthe range. And I wish I knew somebody that had a lot of stable work to\\nbe attended to. I cert'nly do for your sake.”\\n\\n“Why?” said Shorty.\\n\\n“Because it's the right kind of a job for you.”\\n\\n“I can make more--” began Shorty, and stopped.\\n\\n“There is a time coming,” said the Virginian, “when I'll want somebody\\nthat knows how to get the friendship of hawsses. I'll want him to handle\\nsome special hawsses the Judge has plans about. Judge Henry would pay\\nfifty a month for that.”\\n\\n“I can make more,” said Shorty, this time with stubbornness.\\n\\n“Well, yes. Sometimes a man can--when he's not worth it, I mean. But it\\ndon't generally last.”\\n\\nShorty was silent. “I used to make more myself,” said the Virginian.\\n\\n“You're making a lot more now,” said Shorty.\\n\\n“Oh, yes. But I mean when I was fooling around the earth, jumping from\\njob to job, and helling all over town between whiles. I was not worth\\nfifty a month then, nor twenty-five. But there was nights I made a heap\\nmore at cyards.”\\n\\nShorty's eyes grew large.\\n\\n“And then, bang! it was gone with treatin' the men and the girls.”\\n\\n“I don't always--” said Shorty, and stopped again.\\n\\nThe Virginian knew that he was thinking about the money he sent East.\\n“After a while,” he continued, “I noticed a right strange fact. The\\nmoney I made easy that I WASN'T worth, it went like it came. I strained\\nmyself none gettin' or spendin' it. But the money I made hard that I WAS\\nworth, why I began to feel right careful about that. And now I have got\\nsavings stowed away. If once yu' could know how good that feels--”\\n\\n“So I would know,” said Shorty, “with your luck.”\\n\\n“What's my luck?” said the Virginian, sternly.\\n\\n“Well, if I had took up land along a creek that never goes dry and\\nproved upon it like you have, and if I had saw that land raise its value\\non me with me lifting no finger--”\\n\\n“Why did you lift no finger?” cut in the Virginian. “Who stopped yu'\\ntaking up land? Did it not stretch in front of yu', behind yu', all\\naround yu', the biggest, baldest opportunity in sight? That was the time\\nI lifted my finger; but yu' didn't.”\\n\\nShorty stood stubborn.\\n\\n“But never mind that,” said the Virginian. “Take my land away to-morrow,\\nand I'd still have my savings in bank. Because, you see, I had to work\\nright hard gathering them in. I found out what I could do, and I settled\\ndown and did it. Now you can do that too. The only tough part is the\\nfinding out what you're good for. And for you, that is found. If you'll\\njust decide to work at this thing you can do, and gentle those hawsses\\nfor the Judge, you'll be having savings in a bank yourself.”\\n\\n“I can make more,” said the lost dog.\\n\\nThe Virginian was on the point of saying, “Then get out!” But instead,\\nhe spoke kindness to the end. “The weather is freezing yet,” he said,\\n“and it will be for a good long while. Take your time, and tell me if\\nyu' change your mind.”\\n\\nAfter that Shorty returned to the bunk house, and the Virginian knew\\nthat the boy had learned his lesson of discontent from Trampas with\\na thoroughness past all unteaching. This petty triumph of evil seemed\\nscarce of the size to count as any victory over the Virginian. But all\\nmen grasp at straws. Since that first moment, when in the Medicine Bow\\nsaloon the Virginian had shut the mouth of Trampas by a word, the man\\nhad been trying to get even without risk; and at each successive clash\\nof his weapon with the Virginian's, he had merely met another public\\nhumiliation. Therefore, now at the Sunk Creek Ranch in these cold white\\ndays, a certain lurking insolence in his gait showed plainly his opinion\\nthat by disaffecting Shorty he had made some sort of reprisal.\\n\\nYes, he had poisoned the lost dog. In the springtime, when the\\nneighboring ranches needed additional hands, it happened as the\\nVirginian had foreseen,--Trampas departed to a “better job,” as he took\\npains to say, and with him the docile Shorty rode away upon his horse\\nPedro.\\n\\nLove now was not any longer snowbound. The mountain trails were open\\nenough for the sure feet of love's steed--that horse called Monte.\\nBut duty blocked the path of love. Instead of turning his face to Bear\\nCreek, the foreman had other journeys to make, full of heavy work,\\nand watchfulness, and councils with the Judge. The cattle thieves were\\ngrowing bold, and winter had scattered the cattle widely over the range.\\nTherefore the Virginian, instead of going to see her, wrote a letter to\\nhis sweetheart. It was his first.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXIV. A LETTER WITH A MORAL\\n\\n\\nThe letter which the Virginian wrote to Molly Wood was, as has been\\nstated, the first that he had ever addressed to her. I think, perhaps,\\nhe may have been a little shy as to his skill in the epistolary art, a\\nlittle anxious lest any sustained production from his pen might contain\\nblunders that would too staringly remind her of his scant learning. He\\ncould turn off a business communication about steers or stock cars, or\\nany other of the subjects involved in his profession, with a brevity\\nand a clearness that led the Judge to confide three-quarters of such\\ncorrespondence to his foreman. “Write to the 76 outfit,” the Judge would\\nsay, “and tell them that my wagon cannot start for the round-up until,”\\n etc.; or “Write to Cheyenne and say that if they will hold a meeting\\nnext Monday week, I will,” etc. And then the Virginian would write such\\ncommunications with ease.\\n\\nBut his first message to his lady was scarcely written with ease. It\\nmust be classed, I think, among those productions which are styled\\nliterary EFFORTS. It was completed in pencil before it was copied in\\nink; and that first draft of it in pencil was well-nigh illegible with\\nerasures and amendments. The state of mind of the writer during its\\ncomposition may be gathered without further description on my part from\\na slight interruption which occurred in the middle.\\n\\nThe door opened, and Scipio put his head in. “You coming to dinner?” he\\ninquired.\\n\\n“You go to hell,” replied the Virginian.\\n\\n“My jinks!” said Scipio, quietly, and he shut the door without further\\nobservation.\\n\\nTo tell the truth, I doubt if this letter would ever have been\\nundertaken, far less completed and despatched, had not the lover's heart\\nbeen wrung with disappointment. All winter long he had looked to that\\nday when he should knock at the girl's door, and hear her voice bid him\\ncome in. All winter long he had been choosing the ride he would take\\nher. He had imagined a sunny afternoon, a hidden grove, a sheltering\\ncleft of rock, a running spring, and some words of his that should\\nconquer her at last and leave his lips upon hers. And with this\\ncontrolled fire pent up within him, he had counted the days, scratching\\nthem off his calendar with a dig each night that once or twice snapped\\nthe pen. Then, when the trail stood open, this meeting was deferred,\\nput off for indefinite days, or weeks; he could not tell how long.\\nSo, gripping his pencil and tracing heavy words, he gave himself what\\nconsolation he could by writing her.\\n\\nThe letter, duly stamped and addressed to Bear Creek, set forth upon\\nits travels; and these were devious and long. When it reached its\\ndestination, it was some twenty days old. It had gone by private hand\\nat the outset, taken the stagecoach at a way point, become late in\\nthat stagecoach, reached a point of transfer, and waited there for the\\npostmaster to begin, continue, end, and recover from a game of poker,\\nmingled with whiskey. Then it once more proceeded, was dropped at\\nthe right way point, and carried by private hand to Bear Creek. The\\nexperience of this letter, however, was not at all a remarkable one at\\nthat time in Wyoming.\\n\\nMolly Wood looked at the envelope. She had never before seen the\\nVirginian's handwriting. She knew it instantly. She closed her door and\\nsat down to read it with a beating heart.\\n\\nSUNK CREEK RANCH, May 5, 188-\\n\\nMy Dear Miss Wood: I am sorry about this. My plan was different. It was\\nto get over for a ride with you about now or sooner. This year Spring is\\nearly. The snow is off the flats this side the range and where the\\nsun gets a chance to hit the earth strong all day it is green and has\\nflowers too, a good many. You can see them bob and mix together in the\\nwind. The quaking-asps down low on the South side are in small leaf and\\nwill soon be twinkling like the flowers do now. I had planned to take a\\nlook at this with you and that was a better plan than what I have got to\\ndo. The water is high but I could have got over and as for the snow on\\ntop of the mountain a man told me nobody could cross it for a week yet,\\nbecause he had just done it himself. Was not he a funny man? You ought\\nto see how the birds have streamed across the sky while Spring was\\ncoming. But you have seen them on your side of the mountain. But I can't\\ncome now Miss Wood. There is a lot for me to do that has to be done and\\nJudge Henry needs more than two eyes just now. I could not think much of\\nmyself if I left him for my own wishes.\\n\\nBut the days will be warmer when I come. We will not have to quit by\\nfive, and we can get off and sit too. We could not sit now unless for a\\nvery short while. If I know when I can come I will try to let you know,\\nbut I think it will be this way. I think you will just see me coming for\\nI have things to do of an unsure nature and a good number of such. Do\\nnot believe reports about Indians. They are started by editors to keep\\nthe soldiers in the country. The friends of the editors get the hay and\\nbeef contracts. Indians do not come to settled parts like Bear Creek is.\\nIt is all editors and politicianists.\\n\\nNothing has happened worth telling you. I have read that play Othello.\\nNo man should write down such a thing. Do you know if it is true? I have\\nseen one worse affair down in Arizona. He killed his little child as\\nwell as his wife but such things should not be put down in fine language\\nfor the public. I have read Romeo and Juliet. That is beautiful language\\nbut Romeo is no man. I like his friend Mercutio that gets killed. He\\nis a man. If he had got Juliet there would have been no foolishness and\\ntrouble.\\n\\nWell Miss Wood I would like to see you to-day. Do you know what I think\\nMonte would do if I rode him out and let the rein slack? He would come\\nstraight to your gate for he is a horse of great judgement. (“That's the\\nfirst word he has misspelled,” said Molly.) I suppose you are sitting\\nwith George Taylor and those children right now. Then George will get\\nold enough to help his father but Uncle Hewie's twins will be ready for\\nyou about then and the supply will keep coming from all quarters all\\nsizes for you to say big A little a to them. There is no news here. Only\\ncalves and cows and the hens are laying now which does always seem news\\nto a hen every time she does it. Did I ever tell you about a hen Emily\\nwe had here? She was venturesome to an extent I have not seen in other\\nhens only she had poor judgement and would make no family ties. She\\nwould keep trying to get interest in the ties of others taking charge\\nof little chicks and bantams and turkeys and puppies one time, and she\\nthought most anything was an egg. I will tell you about her sometime.\\nShe died without family ties one day while I was building a house for\\nher to teach school in. (“The outrageous wretch!” cried Molly! And her\\ncheeks turned deep pink as she sat alone with her lover's letter.)\\n\\nI am coming the first day I am free. I will be a hundred miles from you\\nmost of the time when I am not more but I will ride a hundred miles for\\none hour and Monte is up to that. After never seeing you for so long I\\nwill make one hour do if I have to. Here is a flower I have just been\\nout and picked. I have kissed it now. That is the best I can do yet.\\n\\nMolly laid the letter in her lap and looked at the flower. Then suddenly\\nshe jumped up and pressed it to her lips, and after a long moment held\\nit away from her.\\n\\n“No,” she said. “No, no, no.” She sat down.\\n\\nIt was some time before she finished the letter. Then once more she got\\nup and put on her hat.\\n\\nMrs. Taylor wondered where the girl could be walking so fast. But she\\nwas not walking anywhere, and in half an hour she returned, rosy with\\nher swift exercise, but with a spirit as perturbed as when she had set\\nout.\\n\\nNext morning at six, when she looked out of her window, there was Monte\\ntied to the Taylor's gate. Ah, could he have come the day before, could\\nshe have found him when she returned from that swift walk of hers!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXV. PROGRESS OF THE LOST DOG\\n\\n\\nIt was not even an hour's visit that the Virginian was able to pay\\nhis lady love. But neither had he come a hundred miles to see her. The\\nnecessities of his wandering work had chanced to bring him close enough\\nfor a glimpse of her, and this glimpse he took, almost on the wing. For\\nhe had to rejoin a company of men at once.\\n\\n“Yu' got my letter?” he said.\\n\\n“Yesterday.”\\n\\n“Yesterday! I wrote it three weeks ago. Well, yu' got it. This cannot\\nbe the hour with you that I mentioned. That is coming, and maybe very\\nsoon.”\\n\\nShe could say nothing. Relief she felt, and yet with it something like a\\npang.\\n\\n“To-day does not count,” he told her, “except that every time I see you\\ncounts with me. But this is not the hour that I mentioned.”\\n\\nWhat little else was said between them upon this early morning shall be\\ntold duly. For this visit in its own good time did count momentously,\\nthough both of them took it lightly while its fleeting minutes passed.\\nHe returned to her two volumes that she had lent him long ago and\\nwith Taylor he left a horse which he had brought for her to ride. As a\\ngood-by, he put a bunch of flowers in her hand. Then he was gone, and\\nshe watched him going by the thick bushes along the stream. They were\\npink with wild roses; and the meadow-larks, invisible in the grass,\\nlike hiding choristers, sent up across the empty miles of air their\\nunexpected song. Earth and sky had been propitious, could he have\\nstayed; and perhaps one portion of her heart had been propitious too.\\nSo, as he rode away on Monte, she watched him, half chilled by reason,\\nhalf melted by passion, self-thwarted, self-accusing, unresolved.\\nTherefore the days that came for her now were all of them unhappy ones,\\nwhile for him they were filled with work well done and with changeless\\nlonging.\\n\\nOne day it seemed as if a lull was coming, a pause in which he could\\nat last attain that hour with her. He left the camp and turned his face\\ntoward Bear Creek. The way led him along Butte Creek. Across the stream\\nlay Balaam's large ranch; and presently on the other bank he saw Balaam\\nhimself, and reined in Monte for a moment to watch what Balaam was\\ndoing.\\n\\n“That's what I've heard,” he muttered to himself. For Balaam had led\\nsome horses to the water, and was lashing them heavily because they\\nwould not drink. He looked at this spectacle so intently that he did not\\nsee Shorty approaching along the trail.\\n\\n“Morning,” said Shorty to him, with some constraint.\\n\\nBut the Virginian gave him a pleasant greeting, “I was afraid I'd not\\ncatch you so quick,” said Shorty. “This is for you.” He handed his\\nrecent foreman a letter of much battered appearance. It was from the\\nJudge. It had not come straight, but very gradually, in the pockets of\\nthree successive cow-punchers. As the Virginian glanced over it and saw\\nthat the enclosure it contained was for Balaam, his heart fell. Here\\nwere new orders for him, and he could not go to see his sweetheart.\\n\\n“Hello, Shorty!” said Balaam, from over the creek. To the Virginian he\\ngave a slight nod. He did not know him, although he knew well enough who\\nhe was.\\n\\n“Hyeh's a letter from Judge Henry for yu'” said the Virginian, and he\\ncrossed the creek.\\n\\nMany weeks before, in the early spring, Balaam had borrowed two horses\\nfrom the Judge, promising to return them at once. But the Judge, of\\ncourse, wrote very civilly. He hoped that “this dunning reminder” might\\nbe excused. As Balaam read the reminder, he wished that he had sent the\\nhorses before. The Judge was a greater man than he in the Territory.\\nBalaam could not but excuse the “dunning reminder,”--but he was ready to\\nbe disagreeable to somebody at once.\\n\\n“Well,” he said, musing aloud in his annoyance, “Judge Henry wants them\\nby the 30th. Well, this is the 24th, and time enough yet.”\\n\\n“This is the 27th,” said the Virginian, briefly.\\n\\nThat made a difference! Not so easy to reach Sunk Creek in good order by\\nthe 30th! Balaam had drifted three sunrises behind the progress of the\\nmonth. Days look alike, and often lose their very names in the quiet\\ndepths of Cattle Land. The horses were not even here at the ranch.\\nBalaam was ready to be very disagreeable now. Suddenly he perceived the\\ndate of the Judge's letter. He held it out to the Virginian, and struck\\nthe paper.\\n\\n“What's your idea in bringing this here two weeks late?” he said.\\n\\nNow, when he had struck that paper, Shorty looked at the Virginian. But\\nnothing happened beyond a certain change of light in the Southerner's\\neyes. And when the Southerner spoke, it was with his usual gentleness\\nand civility. He explained that the letter had been put in his hands\\njust now by Shorty.\\n\\n“Oh,” said Balaam. He looked at Shorty. How had he come to be a\\nmessenger? “You working for the Sunk Creek outfit again?” said he.\\n\\n“No,” said Shorty.\\n\\nBalaam turned to the Virginian again. “How do you expect me to get those\\nhorses to Sunk Creek by the 30th?”\\n\\nThe Virginian levelled a lazy eye on Balaam. “I ain' doin' any\\nexpecting,” said he. His native dialect was on top to-day. “The Judge\\nhas friends goin' to arrive from New Yawk for a trip across the Basin,”\\n he added. “The hawsses are for them.”\\n\\nBalaam grunted with displeasure, and thought of the sixty or seventy\\ndays since he had told the Judge he would return the horses at once.\\nHe looked across at Shorty seated in the shade, and through his uneasy\\nthoughts his instinct irrelevantly noted what a good pony the youth\\nrode. It was the same animal he had seen once or twice before. But\\nsomething must be done. The Judge's horses were far out on the big\\nrange, and must be found and driven in, which would take certainly the\\nrest of this day, possibly part of the next.\\n\\nBalaam called to one of his men and gave some sharp orders, emphasizing\\ndetails, and enjoining haste, while the Virginian leaned slightly\\nagainst his horse, with one arm over the saddle, hearing and\\nunderstanding, but not smiling outwardly. The man departed to saddle up\\nfor his search on the big range, and Balaam resumed the unhitching of\\nhis team.\\n\\n“So you're not working for the Sunk Creek outfit now?” he inquired of\\nShorty. He ignored the Virginian. “Working for the Goose Egg?”\\n\\n“No,” said Shorty.\\n\\n“Sand Hill outfit, then?”\\n\\n“No,” said Shorty.\\n\\nBalaam grinned. He noticed how Shorty's yellow hair stuck through a hole\\nin his hat, and how old and battered were Shorty's overalls. Shorty had\\nbeen glad to take a little accidental pay for becoming the bearer of the\\nletter which he had delivered to the Virginian. But even that sum was no\\nlonger in his possession. He had passed through Drybone on his way, and\\nat Drybone there had been a game of poker. Shorty's money was now in the\\npocket of Trampas. But he had one valuable possession in the world left\\nto him, and that was his horse Pedro.\\n\\n“Good pony of yours,” said Balaam to him now, from across Butte Creek.\\nThen he struck his own horse in the jaw because he held back from coming\\nto the water as the other had done.\\n\\n“Your trace ain't unhitched,” commented the Virginian, pointing.\\n\\nBalaam loosed the strap he had forgotten, and cut the horse again for\\nconsistency's sake. The animal, bewildered, now came down to the water,\\nwith its head in the air, and snuffing as it took short, nervous steps.\\n\\nThe Virginian looked on at this, silent and sombre. He could scarcely\\ninterfere between another man and his own beast. Neither he nor Balaam\\nwas among those who say their prayers. Yet in this omission they were\\nnot equal. A half-great poet once had a wholly great day, and in that\\ngreat day he was able to write a poem that has lived and become, with\\nmany, a household word. He called it The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\\nAnd it is rich with many lines that possess the memory; but these are\\nthe golden ones:\\n\\n    “He prayeth well who loveth well\\n     Both man and bird and beast.\\n\\n     He prayeth best who loveth best\\n     All things both great and small;\\n     For the dear God who loveth us,\\n     He made and loveth all.”\\n\\nThese lines are the pure gold. They are good to teach children; because\\nafter the children come to be men, they may believe at least some part\\nof them still. The Virginian did not know them,--but his heart had\\ntaught him many things. I doubt if Balaam knew them either. But on him\\nthey would have been as pearls to swine.\\n\\n“So you've quit the round-up?” he resumed to Shorty.\\n\\nShorty nodded and looked sidewise at the Virginian.\\n\\nFor the Virginian knew that he had been turned off for going to sleep\\nwhile night-herding.\\n\\nThen Balaam threw another glance on Pedro the horse.\\n\\n“Hello, Shorty!” he called out, for the boy was departing. “Don't you\\nlike dinner any more? It's ready about now.”\\n\\nShorty forded the creek and slung his saddle off, and on invitation\\nturned Pedro, his buckskin pony, into Balaam's pasture. This was green,\\nthe rest of the wide world being yellow, except only where Butte Creek,\\nwith its bordering cottonwoods, coiled away into the desert distance\\nlike a green snake without end. The Virginian also turned his horse into\\nthe pasture. He must stay at the ranch till the Judge's horses should be\\nfound.\\n\\n“Mrs. Balaam's East yet,” said her lord, leading the way to his dining\\nroom.\\n\\nHe wanted Shorty to dine with him, and could not exclude the Virginian,\\nmuch as he should have enjoyed this.\\n\\n“See any Indians?” he enquired.\\n\\n“Na-a!” said Shorty, in disdain of recent rumors.\\n\\n“They're headin' the other way,” observed the Virginian. “Bow Laig Range\\nis where they was repawted.”\\n\\n“What business have they got off the reservation, I'd like to know,”\\n said the ranchman, “Bow Leg, or anywhere?”\\n\\n“Oh, it's just a hunt, and a kind of visitin' their friends on the South\\nReservation,” Shorty explained. “Squaws along and all.”\\n\\n“Well, if the folks at Washington don't keep squaws and all where they\\nbelong,” said Balaam, in a rage, “the folks in Wyoming Territory 'ill do\\na little job that way themselves.”\\n\\n“There's a petition out,” said Shorty. “Paper's goin' East with a lot of\\nnames to it. But they ain't no harm, them Indians ain't.”\\n\\n“No harm?” rasped out Balaam. “Was it white men druv off the O. C.\\nyearlings?”\\n\\nBalaam's Eastern grammar was sometimes at the mercy of his Western\\nfeelings. The thought of the perennial stultification of Indian affairs\\nat Washington, whether by politician or philanthropist, was always sure\\nto arouse him. He walked impatiently about while he spoke, and halted\\nimpatiently at the window. Out in the world the unclouded day was\\nshining, and Balaam's eye travelled across the plains to where a blue\\nline, faint and pale, lay along the end of the vast yellow distance.\\nThat was the beginning of the Bow Leg Mountains. Somewhere over there\\nwere the red men, ranging in unfrequented depths of rock and pine--their\\nforbidden ground.\\n\\nDinner was ready, and they sat down.\\n\\n“And I suppose,” Balaam continued, still hot on the subject, “you'd\\nclaim Indians object to killing a white man when they run on to him good\\nand far from human help? These peaceable Indians are just the worst in\\nthe business.”\\n\\n“That's so,” assented the easy-opinioned Shorty, exactly as if he had\\nalways maintained this view. “Chap started for Sunk Creek three weeks\\nago. Trapper he was; old like, with a red shirt. One of his horses come\\ninto the round-up Toosday. Man ain't been heard from.” He ate in silence\\nfor a while, evidently brooding in his childlike mind. Then he said,\\nquerulously, “I'd sooner trust one of them Indians than I would\\nTrampas.”\\n\\nBalaam slanted his fat bullet head far to one side, and laying his spoon\\ndown (he had opened some canned grapes) laughed steadily at his guest\\nwith a harsh relish of irony.\\n\\nThe guest ate a grape, and perceiving he was seen through, smiled back\\nrather miserably.\\n\\n“Say, Shorty,” said Balaam, his head still slanted over, “what's the\\nfigures of your bank balance just now?”\\n\\n“I ain't usin' banks,” murmured the youth.\\n\\nBalaam put some more grapes on Shorty's plate, and drawing a cigar from\\nhis waistcoat, sent it rolling to his guest.\\n\\n“Matches are behind you,” he added. He gave a cigar to the Virginian as\\nan afterthought, but to his disgust, the Southerner put it in his pocket\\nand lighted a pipe.\\n\\nBalaam accompanied his guest, Shorty, when he went to the pasture to\\nsaddle up and depart. “Got a rope?” he asked the guest, as they lifted\\ndown the bars.\\n\\n“Don't need to rope him. I can walk right up to Pedro. You stay back.”\\n\\nHiding his bridle behind him, Shorty walked to the river-bank, where the\\npony was switching his long tail in the shade; and speaking persuasively\\nto him, he came nearer, till he laid his hand on Pedro's dusky mane,\\nwhich was many shades darker than his hide. He turned expectantly, and\\nhis master came up to his expectations with a piece of bread.\\n\\n“Eats that, does he?” said Balaam, over the bars.\\n\\n“Likes the salt,” said Shorty. “Now, n-n-ow, here! Yu' don't guess\\nyu'll be bridled, don't you? Open your teeth! Yu'd like to play yu' was\\nnobody's horse and live private? Or maybe yu'd prefer ownin' a saloon?”\\n\\nPedro evidently enjoyed this talk, and the dodging he made about the\\nbit. Once fairly in his mouth, he accepted the inevitable, and followed\\nShorty to the bars. Then Shorty turned and extended his hand.\\n\\n“Shake!” he said to his pony, who lifted his forefoot quietly and put it\\nin his master's hand. Then the master tickled his nose, and he wrinkled\\nit and flattened his ears, pretending to bite. His face wore an\\nexpression of knowing relish over this performance. “Now the other\\nhoof,” said Shorty; and the horse and master shook hands with their\\nleft. “I learned him that,” said the cow-boy, with pride and affection.\\n“Say, Pede,” he continued, in Pedro's ear, “ain't yu' the best little\\nhorse in the country? What? Here, now! Keep out of that, you dead-beat!\\nThere ain't no more bread.” He pinched the pony's nose, one quarter of\\nwhich was wedged into his pocket.\\n\\n“Quite a lady's little pet!” said Balaam, with the rasp in his voice.\\n“Pity this isn't New York, now, where there's a big market for harmless\\nhorses. Gee-gees, the children call them.”\\n\\n“He ain't no gee-gee,” said Shorty, offended. “He'll beat any cow-pony\\nworkin' you've got. Yu' can turn him on a half-dollar. Don't need to\\ntouch the reins. Hang 'em on one finger and swing your body, and he'll\\nturn.”\\n\\nBalaam knew this, and he knew that the pony was only a four-year-old.\\n“Well,” he said, “Drybone's had no circus this season. Maybe they'd buy\\ntickets to see Pedro. He's good for that, anyway.”\\n\\nShorty became gloomy. The Virginian was grimly smoking. Here was\\nsomething else going on not to his taste, but none of his business.\\n\\n“Try a circus,” persisted Balaam. “Alter your plans for spending cash in\\ntown, and make a little money instead.”\\n\\nShorty having no plans to alter and no cash to spend, grew still more\\ngloomy.\\n\\n“What'll you take for that pony?” said Balaam.\\n\\nShorty spoke up instantly. “A hundred dollars couldn't buy that piece\\nof stale mud off his back,” he asserted, looking off into the sky\\ngrandiosely.\\n\\nBut Balaam looked at Shorty, “You keep the mud,” he said, “and I'll give\\nyou thirty dollars for the horse.”\\n\\nShorty did a little professional laughing, and began to walk toward his\\nsaddle.\\n\\n“Give you thirty dollars,” repeated Balaam, picking a stone up and\\nslinging it into the river.\\n\\n“How far do yu' call it to Drybone?” Shorty remarked, stooping to\\ninvestigate the bucking-strap on his saddle--a superfluous performance,\\nfor Pedro never bucked.\\n\\n“You won't have to walk,” said Balaam. “Stay all night, and I'll send\\nyou over comfortably in the morning, when the wagon goes for the mail.”\\n\\n“Walk?” Shorty retorted. “Drybone's twenty-five miles. Pedro'll put me\\nthere in three hours and not know he done it.” He lifted the saddle on\\nthe horse's back. “Come, Pedro,” said he.\\n\\n“Come, Pedro!” mocked Balaam.\\n\\nThere followed a little silence.\\n\\n“No, sir,” mumbled Shorty, with his head under Pedro's belly, busily\\ncinching. “A hundred dollars is bottom figures.”\\n\\nBalaam, in his turn, now duly performed some professional laughing,\\nwhich was noted by Shorty under the horse's belly. He stood up and\\nsquared round on Balaam. “Well, then,” he said, “what'll yu give for\\nhim?”\\n\\n“Thirty dollars,” said Balaam, looking far off into the sky, as Shorty\\nhad looked.\\n\\n“Oh, come, now,” expostulated Shorty.\\n\\nIt was he who now did the feeling for an offer and this was what Balaam\\nliked to see. “Why yes,” he said, “thirty,” and looked surprised that he\\nshould have to mention the sum so often.\\n\\n“I thought yu'd quit them first figures,” said the cow-puncher, “for yu'\\ncan see I ain't goin' to look at em.”\\n\\nBalaam climbed on the fence and sat there “I'm not crying for your\\nPedro,” he observed dispassionately. “Only it struck me you were dead\\nbroke, and wanted to raise cash and keep yourself going till you hunted\\nup a job and could buy him back.” He hooked his right thumb inside his\\nwaistcoat pocket. “But I'm not cryin' for him,” he repeated. “He'd stay\\nright here, of course. I wouldn't part with him. Why does he stand that\\nway? Hello!” Balaam suddenly straightened himself, like a man who has\\nmade a discovery.\\n\\n“Hello, what?” said Shorty, on the defensive.\\n\\nBalaam was staring at Pedro with a judicial frown. Then he stuck out a\\nfinger at the horse, keeping the thumb hooked in his pocket. So meagre\\na gesture was felt by the ruffled Shorty to be no just way to point at\\nPedro. “What's the matter with that foreleg there?” said Balaam.\\n\\n“Which? Nothin's the matter with it!” snapped Shorty.\\n\\nBalaam climbed down from his fence and came over with elaborate\\ndeliberation. He passed his hand up and down the off foreleg. Then he\\nspit slenderly. “Mm!” he said thoughtfully; and added, with a shade of\\nsadness, “that's always to be expected when they're worked too young.”\\n\\nShorty slid his hand slowly over the disputed leg. “What's to be\\nexpected?” he inquired--“that they'll eat hearty? Well, he does.”\\n\\nAt this retort the Virginian permitted himself to laugh in audible\\nsympathy.\\n\\n“Sprung,” continued Balaam, with a sigh. “Whirling round short when his\\nbones were soft did that. Yes.”\\n\\n“Sprung!” Shorty said, with a bark of indignation. “Come on, Pede; you\\nand me'll spring for town.”\\n\\nHe caught the horn of the saddle, and as he swung into place the horse\\nrushed away with him. “O-ee! yoi-yup, yup, yup!” sang Shorty, in the\\nshrill cow dialect. He made Pedro play an exhibition game of speed,\\nbringing him round close to Balaam in a wide circle, and then he\\nvanished in dust down the left-bank trail.\\n\\nBalaam looked after him and laughed harshly. He had seen trout dash\\nabout like that when the hook in their jaw first surprised them. He knew\\nShorty would show the pony off, and he knew Shorty's love for Pedro\\nwas not equal to his need of money. He called to one of his men, asked\\nsomething about the dam at the mouth of the canyon, where the main\\nirrigation ditch began, made a remark about the prolonged drought, and\\nthen walked to his dining-room door, where, as he expected, Shorty met\\nhim.\\n\\n“Say,” said the youth, “do you consider that's any way to talk about a\\ngood horse?”\\n\\n“Any dude could see the leg's sprung,” said Balaam. But he looked at\\nPedro's shoulder, which was well laid back; and he admired his points,\\ndark in contrast with the buckskin, and also the width between the eyes.\\n\\n“Now you know,” whined Shorty, “that it ain't sprung any more than your\\nleg's cork. If you mean the right leg ain't plumb straight, I can tell\\nyou he was born so. That don't make no difference, for it ain't weak.\\nTry him onced. Just as sound and strong as iron. Never stumbles. And he\\ndon't never go to jumpin' with yu'. He's kind and he's smart.” And the\\nmaster petted his pony, who lifted a hoof for another handshake.\\n\\nOf course Balaam had never thought the leg was sprung, and he now took\\non an unprejudiced air of wanting to believe Shorty's statements if he\\nonly could.\\n\\n“Maybe there's two years' work left in that leg,” he now observed.\\n\\n“Better give your hawss away, Shorty,” said the Virginian.\\n\\n“Is this your deal, my friend?” inquired Balaam. And he slanted his\\nbullet head at the Virginian.\\n\\n“Give him away, Shorty,” drawled the Southerner. “His laig is busted.\\nMr. Balaam says so.”\\n\\nBalaam's face grew evil with baffled fury. But the Virginian was gravely\\nconsidering Pedro. He, too, was not pleased. But he could not interfere.\\nAlready he had overstepped the code in these matters. He would have\\ndearly liked--for reasons good and bad, spite and mercy mingled--to\\nhave spoiled Balaam's market, to have offered a reasonable or even an\\nunreasonable price for Pedro, and taken possession of the horse himself.\\nBut this might not be. In bets, in card games, in all horse transactions\\nand other matters of similar business, a man must take care of himself,\\nand wiser onlookers must suppress their wisdom and hold their peace.\\n\\nThat evening Shorty again had a cigar. He had parted with Pedro\\nfor forty dollars, a striped Mexican blanket, and a pair of spurs.\\nUndressing over in the bunk house, he said to the Virginian, “I'll sure\\nbuy Pedro back off him just as soon as ever I rustle some cash.” The\\nVirginian grunted. He was thinking he should have to travel hard to\\nget the horses to the Judge by the 30th; and below that thought lay his\\naching disappointment and his longing for Bear Creek.\\n\\nIn the early dawn Shorty sat up among his blankets on the floor of the\\nbunk house and saw the various sleepers coiled or sprawled in their\\nbeds; their breathing had not yet grown restless at the nearing of day.\\nHe stepped to the door carefully, and saw the crowding blackbirds begin\\ntheir walk and chatter in the mud of the littered and trodden corrals.\\nFrom beyond among the cottonwoods, came continually the smooth\\nunemphatic sound of the doves answering each other invisibly; and\\nagainst the empty ridge of the river-bluff lay the moon, no longer\\nshining, for there was established a new light through the sky. Pedro\\nstood in the pasture close to the bars. The cow-boy slowly closed the\\ndoor behind him, and sitting down on the step, drew his money out and\\nidly handled it, taking no comfort just then from its possession. Then\\nhe put it back, and after dragging on his boots, crossed to the pasture,\\nand held a last talk with his pony, brushing the cakes of mud from his\\nhide where he had rolled, and passing a lingering hand over his mane. As\\nthe sounds of the morning came increasingly from tree and plain, Shorty\\nglanced back to see that no one was yet out of the cabin, and then put\\nhis arms round the horse's neck, laying his head against him. For a\\nmoment the cow-boy's insignificant face was exalted by the emotion he\\nwould never have let others see. He hugged tight this animal, who was\\ndearer to his heart than anybody in the world.\\n\\n“Good-by, Pedro,” he said--“good-by.” Pedro looked for bread.\\n\\n“No,” said his master, sorrowfully, “not any more. Yu' know well I'd\\ngive it yu' if I had it. You and me didn't figure on this, did we,\\nPedro? Good-by!”\\n\\nHe hugged his pony again, and got as far as the bars of the pasture, but\\nreturned once more. “Good-by, my little horse, my dear horse, my little,\\nlittle Pedro,” he said, as his tears wet the pony's neck. Then he\\nwiped them with his hand, and got himself back to the bunk house. After\\nbreakfast he and his belongings departed to Drybone, and Pedro from his\\nfield calmly watched this departure; for horses must recognize even less\\nthan men the black corners that their destinies turn. The pony stopped\\nfeeding to look at the mail-wagon pass by; but the master sitting in the\\nwagon forebore to turn his head.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXVI. BALAAM AND PEDRO\\n\\n\\nResigned to wait for the Judge's horses, Balaam went into his office\\nthis dry, bright morning and read nine accumulated newspapers; for\\nhe was behindhand. Then he rode out on the ditches, and met his man\\nreturning with the troublesome animals at last. He hastened home and\\nsent for the Virginian. He had made a decision.\\n\\n“See here,” he said; “those horses are coming. What trail would you take\\nover to the Judge's?”\\n\\n“Shortest trail's right through the Bow Laig Mountains,” said the\\nforeman, in his gentle voice.\\n\\n“Guess you're right. It's dinner-time. We'll start right afterward.\\nWe'll make Little Muddy Crossing by sundown, and Sunk Creek to-morrow,\\nand the next day'll see us through. Can a wagon get through Sunk Creek\\nCanyon?”\\n\\nThe Virginian smiled. “I reckon it can't, seh, and stay resembling a\\nwagon.”\\n\\nBalaam told them to saddle Pedro and one packhorse, and drive the bunch\\nof horses into a corral, roping the Judge's two, who proved extremely\\nwild. He had decided to take this journey himself on remembering certain\\npolitics soon to be rife in Cheyenne. For Judge Henry was indeed a\\ngreater man than Balaam. This personally conducted return of the horses\\nwould temper its tardiness, and, moreover, the sight of some New York\\nvisitors would be a good thing after seven months of no warmer touch\\nwith that metropolis than the Sunday HERALD, always eight days old when\\nit reached the Butte Creek Ranch.\\n\\nThey forded Butte Creek, and, crossing the well-travelled trail which\\nfollows down to Drybone, turned their faces toward the uninhabited\\ncountry that began immediately, as the ocean begins off a sandy shore.\\nAnd as a single mast on which no sail is shining stands at the horizon\\nand seems to add a loneliness to the surrounding sea, so the long gray\\nline of fence, almost a mile away, that ended Balaam's land on this side\\nthe creek, stretched along the waste ground and added desolation to\\nthe plain. No solitary watercourse with margin of cottonwoods or willow\\nthickets flowed here to stripe the dingy, yellow world with interrupting\\ngreen, nor were cattle to be seen dotting the distance, nor moving\\nobjects at all, nor any bird in the soundless air. The last gate was\\nshut by the Virginian, who looked back at the pleasant trees of the\\nranch, and then followed on in single file across the alkali of No Man's\\nLand.\\n\\nNo cloud was in the sky. The desert's grim noon shone sombrely on flat\\nand hill. The sagebrush was dull like zinc. Thick heat rose near at hand\\nfrom the caked alkali, and pale heat shrouded the distant peaks.\\n\\nThere were five horses. Balaam led on Pedro, his squat figure stiff in\\nthe saddle, but solid as a rock, and tilted a little forward, as his\\nhabit was. One of the Judge's horses came next, a sorrel, dragging back\\ncontinually on the rope by which he was led. After him ambled Balaam's\\nwise pack-animal, carrying the light burden of two days' food and\\nlodging. She was an old mare who could still go when she chose, but had\\nbeen schooled by the years, and kept the trail, giving no trouble to the\\nVirginian who came behind her. He also sat solid as a rock, yet subtly\\nbending to the struggles of the wild horse he led, as a steel spring\\nbends and balances and resumes its poise.\\n\\nThus they made but slow time, and when they topped the last dull rise of\\nground and looked down on the long slant of ragged, caked earth to the\\ncrossing of Little Muddy, with its single tree and few mean bushes, the\\nfinal distance where eyesight ends had deepened to violet from the thin,\\nsteady blue they had stared at for so many hours, and all heat was\\ngone from the universal dryness. The horses drank a long time from the\\nsluggish yellow water, and its alkaline taste and warmth were equally\\nwelcome to the men. They built a little fire, and when supper was ended,\\nsmoked but a short while and in silence, before they got in the blankets\\nthat were spread in a smooth place beside the water.\\n\\nThey had picketed the two horses of the Judge in the best grass they\\ncould find, letting the rest go free to find pasture where they could.\\nWhen the first light came, the Virginian attended to breakfast, while\\nBalaam rode away on the sorrel to bring in the loose horses. They had\\ngone far out of sight, and when he returned with them, after some two\\nhours, he was on Pedro. Pedro was soaking with sweat, and red froth\\ncreamed from his mouth. The Virginian saw the horses must have been hard\\nto drive in, especially after Balaam brought them the wild sorrel as a\\nleader.\\n\\n“If you'd kep' ridin' him, 'stead of changin' off on your hawss, they'd\\nhave behaved quieter,” said the foreman.\\n\\n“That's good seasonable advice,” said Balaam, sarcastically. “I could\\nhave told you that now.”\\n\\n“I could have told you when you started,” said the Virginian, heating\\nthe coffee for Balaam.\\n\\nBalaam was eloquent on the outrageous conduct of the horses. He had come\\nup with them evidently striking back for Butte Creek, with the old mare\\nin the lead.\\n\\n“But I soon showed her the road she was to go,” he said, as he drove\\nthem now to the water.\\n\\nThe Virginian noticed the slight limp of the mare, and how her pastern\\nwas cut as if with a stone or the sharp heel of a boot.\\n\\n“I guess she'll not be in a hurry to travel except when she's wanted\\nto,” continued Balaam. He sat down, and sullenly poured himself some\\ncoffee. “We'll be in luck if we make any Sunk Creek this night.”\\n\\nHe went on with his breakfast, thinking aloud for the benefit of his\\ncompanion, who made no comments, preferring silence to the discomfort of\\ntalking with a man whose vindictive humor was so thoroughly uppermost.\\nHe did not even listen very attentively, but continued his preparations\\nfor departure, washing the dishes, rolling the blankets, and moving\\nabout in his usual way of easy and visible good nature.\\n\\n“Six o'clock, already,” said Balaam, saddling the horses. “And we'll\\nnot get started for ten minutes more.” Then he came to Pedro. “So you\\nhaven't quit fooling yet, haven't you?” he exclaimed, for the pony\\nshrank as he lifted the bridle. “Take that for your sore mouth!” and he\\nrammed the bit in, at which Pedro flung back and reared.\\n\\n“Well, I never saw Pedro act that way yet,” said the Virginian.\\n\\n“Ah, rubbish!” said Balaam. “They're all the same. Not a bastard one\\nbut's laying for his chance to do for you. Some'll buck you off, and\\nsome'll roll with you, and some'll fight you with their fore feet. They\\nmay play good for a year, but the Western pony's man's enemy, and when\\nhe judges he's got his chance, he's going to do his best. And if you\\ncome out alive it won't be his fault.” Balaam paused for a while,\\npacking. “You've got to keep them afraid of you,” he said next; “that's\\nwhat you've got to do if you don't want trouble. That Pedro horse there\\nhas been fed, hand-fed, and fooled with like a damn pet, and what's that\\npolicy done? Why, he goes ugly when he thinks it's time, and decides\\nhe'll not drive any horses into camp this morning. He knows better now.”\\n\\n“Mr. Balaam,” said the Virginian, “I'll buy that hawss off yu' right\\nnow.”\\n\\nBalaam shook his head. “You'll not do that right now or any other time,”\\n said he. “I happen to want him.”\\n\\nThe Virginian could do no more. He had heard cow-punchers say to\\nrefractory ponies, “You keep still, or I'll Balaam you!” and he now\\nunderstood the aptness of the expression.\\n\\nMeanwhile Balaam began to lead Pedro to the creek for a last drink\\nbefore starting across the torrid drought. The horse held back on the\\nrein a little, and Balaam turned and cut the whip across his forehead.\\nA delay of forcing and backing followed, while the Virginian, already\\nin the saddle, waited. The minutes passed, and no immediate prospect,\\napparently, of getting nearer Sunk Creek.\\n\\n“He ain' goin' to follow you while you're beatin' his haid,” the\\nSoutherner at length remarked.\\n\\n“Do you think you can teach me anything about horses?” retorted Balaam.\\n\\n“Well, it don't look like I could,” said the Virginian, lazily.\\n\\n“Then don't try it, so long as it's not your horse, my friend.”\\n\\nAgain the Southerner levelled his eye on Balaam. “All right,” he said,\\nin the same gentle voice. “And don't you call me your friend. You've\\nmade that mistake twiced.”\\n\\nThe road was shadeless, as it had been from the start, and they could\\nnot travel fast. During the first few hours all coolness was driven out\\nof the glassy morning, and another day of illimitable sun invested the\\nworld with its blaze. The pale Bow Leg Range was coming nearer, but its\\nhard hot slants and rifts suggested no sort of freshness, and even\\nthe pines that spread for wide miles along near the summit counted for\\nnothing in the distance and the glare, but seemed mere patches of dull\\ndry discoloration. No talk was exchanged between the two travellers, for\\nthe cow-puncher had nothing to say and Balaam was sulky, so they moved\\nalong in silent endurance of each other's company and the tedium of the\\njourney.\\n\\nBut the slow succession of rise and fall in the plain changed and\\nshortened. The earth's surface became lumpy, rising into mounds and\\nknotted systems of steep small hills cut apart by staring gashes of\\nsand, where water poured in the spring from the melting snow. After a\\ntime they ascended through the foot-hills till the plain below was for a\\nwhile concealed, but came again into view in its entirety, distant and a\\nthing of the past, while some magpies sailed down to meet them from\\nthe new country they were entering. They passed up through a small\\ntransparent forest of dead trees standing stark and white, and a little\\nhigher came on a line of narrow moisture that crossed the way and formed\\na stale pool among some willow thickets. They turned aside to water\\ntheir horses, and found near the pool a circular spot of ashes and some\\npoles lying, and beside these a cage-like edifice of willow wands built\\nin the ground.\\n\\n“Indian camp,” observed the Virginian.\\n\\nThere were the tracks of five or six horses on the farther side of the\\npool, and they did not come into the trail, but led off among the rocks\\non some system of their own.\\n\\n“They're about a week old,” said Balaam. “It's part of that outfit\\nthat's been hunting.”\\n\\n“They've gone on to visit their friends,” added the cow-puncher.\\n\\n“Yes, on the Southern Reservation. How far do you call Sunk Creek now?”\\n\\n“Well,” said the Virginian, calculating, “it's mighty nigh fo'ty miles\\nfrom Muddy Crossin', an' I reckon we've come eighteen.”\\n\\n“Just about. It's noon.” Balaam snapped his watch shut. “We'll rest here\\ntill 12:30.”\\n\\nWhen it was time to go, the Virginian looked musingly at the mountains.\\n“We'll need to travel right smart to get through the canyon to-night,”\\n he said.\\n\\n“Tell you what,” said Balaam; “we'll rope the Judge's horses together\\nand drive 'em in front of us. That'll make speed.”\\n\\n“Mightn't they get away on us?” objected the Virginian. “They're pow'ful\\nwild.”\\n\\n“They can't get away from me, I guess,” said Balaam, and the arrangement\\nwas adopted. “We're the first this season over this piece of the trail,”\\n he observed presently.\\n\\nHis companion had noticed the ground already, and assented. There were\\nno tracks anywhere to be seen over which winter had not come and gone\\nsince they had been made. Presently the trail wound into a sultry gulch\\nthat hemmed in the heat and seemed to draw down the sun's rays more\\nvertically. The sorrel horse chose this place to make a try for liberty.\\nHe suddenly whirled from the trail, dragging with him his less inventive\\nfellow. Leaving the Virginian with the old mare, Balaam headed them off,\\nfor Pedro was quick, and they came jumping down the bank together, but\\nswiftly crossed up on the other side, getting much higher before they\\ncould be reached. It was no place for this sort of game, as the sides of\\nthe ravine were ploughed with steep channels, broken with jutting knobs\\nof rock, and impeded by short twisted pines that swung out from their\\nroots horizontally over the pitch of the hill. The Virginian helped,\\nbut used his horse with more judgment, keeping as much on the level as\\npossible, and endeavoring to anticipate the next turn of the runaways\\nbefore they made it, while Balaam attempted to follow them close,\\nwheeling short when they doubled, heavily beating up the face of the\\nslope, veering again to come down to the point he had left, and whenever\\nhe felt Pedro begin to flag, driving his spurs into the horse and\\nforcing him to keep up the pace. He had set out to overtake and capture\\non the side of the mountain these two animals who had been running\\nwild for many weeks, and now carried no weight but themselves, and\\nthe futility of such work could not penetrate his obstinate and rising\\ntemper. He had made up his mind not to give in. The Virginian soon\\ndecided to move slowly along for the present, preventing the wild horses\\nfrom passing down the gulch again, but otherwise saving his own animal\\nfrom useless fatigue. He saw that Pedro was reeking wet, with mouth\\nopen, and constantly stumbling, though he galloped on. The cow-puncher\\nkept the group in sight, driving the packhorse in front of him, and\\nwatching the tactics of the sorrel, who had now undoubtedly become\\nthe leader of the expedition, and was at the top of the gulch, in vain\\ntrying to find an outlet through its rocky rim to the levels above. He\\nsoon judged this to be no thoroughfare, and changing his plan, trotted\\ndown to the bottom and up the other side, gaining more and more; for\\nin this new descent Pedro had fallen twice. Then the sorrel showed the\\ncleverness of a genuinely vicious horse. The Virginian saw him stop\\nand fall to kicking his companion with all the energy that a short rope\\nwould permit. The rope slipped, and both, unencumbered, reached the top\\nand disappeared. Leaving the packhorse for Balaam, the Virginian started\\nafter them and came into a high tableland, beyond which the mountains\\nbegan in earnest. The runaways were moving across toward these at an\\neasy rate. He followed for a moment, then looking back, and seeing no\\nsign of Balaam, waited, for the horses were sure not to go fast when\\nthey reached good pasture or water.\\n\\nHe got out of the saddle and sat on the ground, watching, till the mare\\ncame up slowly into sight, and Balaam behind her. When they were near,\\nBalaam dismounted and struck Pedro fearfully, until the stick broke, and\\nhe raised the splintered half to continue.\\n\\nSeeing the pony's condition, the Virginian spoke, and said, “I'd let\\nthat hawss alone.”\\n\\nBalaam turned to him, but wholly possessed by passion did not seem to\\nhear, and the Southerner noticed how white and like that of a maniac his\\nface was. The stick slid to the ground.\\n\\n“He played he was tired,” said Balaam, looking at the Virginian with\\nglazed eyes. The violence of his rage affected him physically, like some\\nstroke of illness. “He played out on me on purpose.” The man's voice\\nwas dry and light. “He's perfectly fresh now,” he continued, and turned\\nagain to the coughing, swaying horse, whose eyes were closed. Not having\\nthe stick, he seized the animal's unresisting head and shook it. The\\nVirginian watched him a moment, and rose to stop such a spectacle. Then,\\nas if conscious he was doing no real hurt, Balaam ceased, and turning\\nagain in slow fashion looked across the level, where the runaways were\\nstill visible.\\n\\n“I'll have to take your horse,” he said, “mine's played out on me.”\\n\\n“You ain' goin' to touch my hawss.”\\n\\nAgain the words seemed not entirely to reach Balaam's understanding, so\\ndulled by rage were his senses. He made no answer, but mounted Pedro;\\nand the failing pony walked mechanically forward, while the Virginian,\\npuzzled, stood looking after him. Balaam seemed without purpose of going\\nanywhere, and stopped in a moment. Suddenly he was at work at something.\\nThis sight was odd and new to look at. For a few seconds it had no\\nmeaning to the Virginian as he watched. Then his mind grasped the\\nhorror, too late. Even with his cry of execration and the tiger spring\\nthat he gave to stop Balaam, the monstrosity was wrought. Pedro sank\\nmotionless, his head rolling flat on the earth. Balaam was jammed\\nbeneath him. The man had struggled to his feet before the Virginian\\nreached the spot, and the horse then lifted his head and turned it\\npiteously round.\\n\\nThen vengeance like a blast struck Balaam. The Virginian hurled him to\\nthe ground, lifted and hurled him again, lifted him and beat his face\\nand struck his jaw. The man's strong ox-like fighting availed nothing.\\nHe fended his eyes as best he could against these sledge-hammer blows\\nof justice. He felt blindly for his pistol. That arm was caught and\\nwrenched backward, and crushed and doubled. He seemed to hear his own\\nbones, and set up a hideous screaming of hate and pain. Then the\\npistol at last came out, and together with the hand that grasped it was\\ninstantly stamped into the dust. Once again the creature was lifted and\\nslung so that he lay across Pedro's saddle a blurred, dingy, wet pulp.\\n\\nVengeance had come and gone. The man and the horse were motionless.\\nAround them, silence seemed to gather like a witness.\\n\\n“If you are dead,” said the Virginian, “I am glad of it.” He stood\\nlooking down at Balaam and Pedro, prone in the middle of the open\\ntableland. Then he saw Balaam looking at him. It was the quiet stare of\\nsight without thought or feeling, the mere visual sense alone, almost\\nfrightful in its separation from any self. But as he watched those\\neyes, the self came back into them. “I have not killed you,” said the\\nVirginian. “Well, I ain't goin' to do any more to yu'--if that's a\\nsatisfaction to know.”\\n\\nThen he began to attend to Balaam with impersonal skill, like some one\\nhired for the purpose. “He ain't hurt bad,” he asserted aloud, as if\\nthe man were some nameless patient; and then to Balaam he remarked, “I\\nreckon it might have put a less tough man than you out of business for\\nquite a while. I'm goin' to get some water now.” When he returned with\\nthe water, Balsam was sitting up, looking about him. He had not yet\\nspoken, nor did he now speak. The sunlight flashed on the six-shooter\\nwhere it lay, and the Virginian secured it. “She ain't so pretty as she\\nwas,” he remarked, as he examined the weapon. “But she'll go right handy\\nyet.”\\n\\nStrength was in a measure returning to Pedro. He was a young horse,\\nand the exhaustion neither of anguish nor of over-riding was enough\\nto affect him long or seriously. He got himself on his feet and walked\\nwaveringly over to the old mare, and stood by her for comfort. The\\ncow-puncher came up to him, and Pedro, after starting back slightly,\\nseemed to comprehend that he was in friendly hands. It was plain that he\\nwould soon be able to travel slowly if no weight was on him, and that he\\nwould be a very good horse again. Whether they abandoned the runaways or\\nnot, there was no staying here for night to overtake them without food\\nor water. The day was still high, and what its next few hours had in\\nstore the Virginian could not say, and he left them to take care of\\nthemselves, determining meanwhile that he would take command of the\\nminutes and maintain the position he had assumed both as to Balaam and\\nPedro. He took Pedro's saddle off, threw the mare's pack to the ground,\\nput Balaam's saddle on her, and on that stowed or tied her original\\npack, which he could do, since it was so light. Then he went to Balaam,\\nwho was sitting up.\\n\\n“I reckon you can travel,” said the Virginian. “And your hawss can. If\\nyou're comin' with me, you'll ride your mare. I'm goin' to trail them\\nhawsses. If you're not comin' with me, your hawss comes with me, and\\nyou'll take fifty dollars for him.”\\n\\nBalaam was indifferent to this good bargain. He did not look at the\\nother or speak, but rose and searched about him on the ground. The\\nVirginian was also indifferent as to whether Balaam chose to answer or\\nnot. Seeing Balaam searching the ground, he finished what he had to say.\\n\\n“I have your six-shooter, and you'll have it when I'm ready for you to.\\nNow, I'm goin',” he concluded.\\n\\nBalaam's intellect was clear enough now, and he saw that though the rest\\nof this journey would be nearly intolerable, it must go on. He looked\\nat the impassive cow-puncher getting ready to go and tying a rope on\\nPedro's neck to lead him, then he looked at the mountains where the\\nrunaways had vanished, and it did not seem credible to him that he had\\ncome into such straits. He was helped stiffly on the mare, and the three\\nhorses in single file took up their journey once more, and came slowly\\namong the mountains. The perpetual desert was ended, and they crossed a\\nsmall brook, where they missed the trail. The Virginian dismounted to\\nfind where the horses had turned off, and discovered that they had gone\\nstraight up the ridge by the watercourse.\\n\\n“There's been a man camped in hyeh inside a month,” he said, kicking up\\na rag of red flannel. “White man and two hawsses. Ours have went up his\\nold tracks.”\\n\\nIt was not easy for Balaam to speak yet, and he kept his silence. But he\\nremembered that Shorty had spoken of a trapper who had started for Sunk\\nCreek.\\n\\nFor three hours they followed the runaways' course over softer ground,\\nand steadily ascending, passed one or two springs, at length, where\\nthe mud was not yet settled in the hoofprints. Then they came through\\na corner of pine forest and down a sudden bank among quaking-asps to a\\ngreen park. Here the runaways beside a stream were grazing at ease, but\\nsaw them coming, and started on again, following down the stream.\\nFor the present all to be done was to keep them in sight. This creek\\nreceived tributaries and widened, making a valley for itself. Above\\nthe bottom, lining the first terrace of the ridge, began the pines, and\\nstretched back, unbroken over intervening summit and basin, to cease at\\nlast where the higher peaks presided.\\n\\n“This hyeh's the middle fork of Sunk Creek,” said the Virginian. “We'll\\nget on to our right road again where they join.”\\n\\nSoon a game trail marked itself along the stream. If this would only\\ncontinue, the runaways would be nearly sure to follow it down into the\\ncanyon. Then there would be no way for them but to go on and come out\\ninto their own country, where they would make for the Judge's ranch of\\ntheir own accord. The great point was to reach the canyon before dark.\\nThey passed into permanent shadow; for though the other side of\\nthe creek shone in full day, the sun had departed behind the ridges\\nimmediately above them. Coolness filled the air, and the silence, which\\nin this deep valley of invading shadow seemed too silent, was relieved\\nby the birds. Not birds of song, but a freakish band of gray talkative\\nobservers, who came calling and croaking along through the pines, and\\ninspected the cavalcade, keeping it company for a while, and then flying\\nup into the woods again. The travellers came round a corner on a little\\nspread of marsh, and from somewhere in the middle of it rose a buzzard\\nand sailed on its black pinions into the air above them, wheeling\\nand wheeling, but did not grow distant. As it swept over the trail,\\nsomething fell from its claw, a rag of red flannel; and each man in turn\\nlooked at it as his horse went by.\\n\\n“I wonder if there's plenty elk and deer hyeh?” said the Virginian.\\n\\n“I guess there is,” Balaam replied, speaking at last. The travellers had\\nbecome strangely reconciled.\\n\\n“There's game 'most all over these mountains,” the Virginian continued;\\n“country not been settled long enough to scare them out.” So they fell\\ninto casual conversation, and for the first time were glad of each\\nother's company.\\n\\nThe sound of a new bird came from the pines above--the hoot of an\\nowl--and was answered from some other part of the wood. This they did\\nnot particularly notice at first, but soon they heard the same note,\\nunexpectedly distant, like an echo. The game trail, now quite a defined\\npath beside the river, showed no sign of changing its course or fading\\nout into blank ground, as these uncertain guides do so often. It led\\nconsistently in the desired direction, and the two men were relieved to\\nsee it continue. Not only were the runaways easier to keep track of,\\nbut better speed was made along this valley. The pervading imminence of\\nnight more and more dispelled the lingering afternoon, though there was\\nyet no twilight in the open, and the high peaks opposite shone yellow\\nin the invisible sun. But now the owls hooted again. Their music had\\nsomething in it that caused both the Virginian and Balaam to look up at\\nthe pines and wish that this valley would end. Perhaps it was early for\\nnight-birds to begin; or perhaps it was that the sound never seemed to\\nfall behind, but moved abreast of them among the trees above, as they\\nrode on without pause down below; some influence made the faces of the\\ntravellers grave. The spell of evil which the sight of the wheeling\\nbuzzard had begun, deepened as evening grew, while ever and again along\\nthe creek the singular call and answer of the owls wandered among the\\ndarkness of the trees not far away.\\n\\nThe sun was gone from the peaks when at length the other side of the\\nstream opened into a long wide meadow. The trail they followed, after\\ncrossing a flat willow thicket by the water, ran into dense pines, that\\nhere for the first time reached all the way down to the water's edge.\\nThe two men came out of the willows, and saw ahead the capricious\\nrunaways leave the bottom and go up the hill and enter the wood.\\n\\n“We must hinder that,” said the Virginian; and he dropped Pedro's rope.\\n“There's your six-shooter. You keep the trail, and camp down there”--he\\npointed to where the trees came to the water--“till I head them hawsses\\noff. I may not get back right away.” He galloped up the open hill\\nand went into the pine, choosing a place above where the vagrants had\\ndisappeared.\\n\\nBalaam dismounted, and picking up his six-shooter, took the rope off\\nPedro's neck and drove him slowly down toward where the wood began.\\nIts interior was already dim, and Balaam saw that here must be their\\nstopping-place to-night, since there was no telling how wide this pine\\nstrip might extend along the trail before they could come out of it and\\nreach another suitable camping-ground. Pedro had recovered his strength,\\nand he now showed signs of restlessness. He shied where there was not\\neven a stone in the trail, and finally turned sharply round. Balaam\\nexpected he was going to rush back on the way they had come; but the\\nhorse stood still, breathing excitedly. He was urged forward again,\\nthough he turned more than once. But when they were a few paces from the\\nwood, and Balaam had got off preparatory to camping, the horse snorted\\nand dashed into the water, and stood still there. The astonished Balaam\\nfollowed to turn him; but Pedro seemed to lose control of himself,\\nand plunged to the middle of the river, and was evidently intending to\\ncross. Fearing that he would escape to the opposite meadow and add to\\ntheir difficulties, Balaam, with the idea of turning him round, drew his\\nsix-shooter and fired in front of the horse, divining, even as the flash\\ncut the dusk, the secret of all this--the Indians; but too late. His\\nbruised hand had stiffened, marring his aim, and he saw Pedro fall over\\nin the water then rise and struggle up the bank on the farther shore,\\nwhere he now hurried also, to find that he had broken the pony's leg.\\n\\nHe needed no interpreter for the voices of the seeming owls that had\\nhaunted the latter hour of their journey, and he knew that his beast's\\nkeener instinct had perceived the destruction that lurked in the\\ninterior of the wood. The history of the trapper whose horse had\\nreturned without him might have been--might still be--his own; and he\\nthought of the rag that had fallen from the buzzard's talons when he had\\nbeen disturbed at his meal in the marsh. “Peaceable” Indians were still\\nin these mountains, and some few of them had for the past hour been\\nskirting his journey unseen, and now waited for him in the wood which\\nthey expected him to enter. They had been too wary to use their rifles\\nor show themselves, lest these travellers should be only part of a\\nlarger company following, who would hear the noise of a shot, and catch\\nthem in the act of murder. So, safe under the cover of the pines, they\\nhad planned to sling their silent noose, and drag the white man from his\\nhorse as he passed through the trees.\\n\\nBalaam looked over the river at the ominous wood, and then he looked\\nat Pedro, the horse that he had first maimed and now ruined, to whom he\\nprobably owed his life. He was lying on the ground, quietly looking over\\nthe green meadow, where dusk was gathering. Perhaps he was not suffering\\nfrom his wound yet, as he rested on the ground; and into his animal\\nintelligence there probably came no knowledge of this final stroke of\\nhis fate. At any rate, no sound of pain came from Pedro, whose friendly\\nand gentle face remained turned toward the meadow. Once more Balaam\\nfired his pistol, and this time the aim was true, and the horse rolled\\nover, with a ball through his brain. It was the best reward that\\nremained for him.\\n\\nThen Balaam rejoined the old mare, and turned from the middle fork of\\nSunk Creek. He dashed across the wide field, and went over a ridge, and\\nfound his way along in the night till he came to the old trail--the\\nroad which they would never have left but for him and his obstinacy. He\\nunsaddled the weary mare by Sunk Creek, where the canyon begins, letting\\nher drag a rope and find pasture and water, while he, lighting no fire\\nto betray him, crouched close under a tree till the light came. He\\nthought of the Virginian in the wood. But what could either have done\\nfor the other had he stayed to look for him among the pines? If the\\ncow-puncher came back to the corner, he would follow Balaam's tracks or\\nnot. They would meet, at any rate, where the creeks joined.\\n\\nBut they did not meet. And then to Balaam the prospect of going onward\\nto the Sunk Creek Ranch became more than he could bear. To come without\\nthe horses, to meet Judge Henry, to meet the guests of the Judge's,\\nlooking as he did now after his punishment by the Virginian, to give the\\nnews about the Judge's favorite man--no, how could he tell such a story\\nas this? Balaam went no farther than a certain cabin, where he slept,\\nand wrote a letter to the Judge. This the owner of the cabin delivered.\\nAnd so, having spread news which would at once cause a search for the\\nVirginian, and having constructed such sentences to the Judge as would\\nmost smoothly explain how, being overtaken by illness, he had not wished\\nto be a burden at Sunk Creek, Balaam turned homeward by himself. By the\\ntime he was once more at Butte Creek, his general appearance was a thing\\nless to be noticed. And there was Shorty, waiting!\\n\\nOne way and another, the lost dog had been able to gather some ready\\nmoney. He was cheerful because of this momentary purseful of prosperity.\\n\\n“And so I come back, yu' see,” he said. “For I figured on getting Pedro\\nback as soon as I could when I sold him to yu'.”\\n\\n“You're behind the times, Shorty,” said Balaam.\\n\\nShorty looked blank. “You've sure not sold Pedro?” he exclaimed.\\n\\n“Them Indians,” said Balaam, “got after me on the Bow Leg trail. Got\\nafter me and that Virginia man. But they didn't get me.”\\n\\nBalaam wagged his bullet head to imply that this escape was due to his\\nown superior intelligence. The Virginian had been stupid, and so the\\nIndians had got him. “And they shot your horse,” Balaam finished. “Stop\\nand get some dinner with the boys.”\\n\\nHaving eaten, Shorty rode away in mournful spirits. For he had made so\\nsure of once more riding and talking with Pedro, his friend whom he had\\ntaught to shake hands.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXVII. GRANDMOTHER STARK\\n\\n\\nExcept for its chair and bed, the cabin was stripped almost bare. Amid\\nits emptiness of dismantled shelves and walls and floor, only the tiny\\nancestress still hung in her place, last token of the home that had\\nbeen. This miniature, tacked against the despoiled boards, and its\\ndescendant, the angry girl with her hand on an open box-lid, made a sort\\nof couple in the loneliness: she on the wall sweet and serene, she by\\nthe box sweet and stormy. The picture was her final treasure waiting to\\nbe packed for the journey. In whatever room she had called her own\\nsince childhood, there it had also lived and looked at her, not quite\\nfamiliar, not quite smiling, but in its prim colonial hues delicate as\\nsome pressed flower. Its pale oval, of color blue and rose and\\nflaxen, in a battered, pretty gold frame, unconquerably pervaded any\\nsurroundings with a something like last year's lavender. Till yesterday\\na Crow Indian war-bonnet had hung next it, a sumptuous cascade of\\nfeathers; on the other side a bow with arrows had dangled; opposite had\\nbeen the skin of a silver fox; over the door had spread the antlers of\\na black-tail deer; a bearskin stretched beneath it. Thus had the whole\\ncosey log cabin been upholstered, lavish with trophies of the frontier;\\nand yet it was in front of the miniature that the visitors used to stop.\\n\\nShining quietly now in the cabin's blackness this summer day, the\\nheirloom was presiding until the end. And as Molly Wood's eyes fell upon\\nher ancestress of Bennington, 1777, there flashed a spark of steel in\\nthem, alone here in the room that she was leaving forever. She was not\\ngoing to teach school any more on Bear Creek, Wyoming; she was going\\nhome to Bennington, Vermont. When time came for school to open again,\\nthere should be a new schoolmarm.\\n\\nThis was the momentous result of that visit which the Virginian had paid\\nher. He had told her that he was coming for his hour soon. From that\\nhour she had decided to escape. She was running away from her own heart.\\nShe did not dare to trust herself face to face again with her potent,\\nindomitable lover. She longed for him, and therefore she would never see\\nhim again. No great-aunt at Dunbarton, or anybody else that knew her and\\nher family, should ever say that she had married below her station, had\\nbeen an unworthy Stark! Accordingly, she had written to the Virginian,\\nbidding him good-by, and wishing him everything in the world. As she\\nhappened to be aware that she was taking everything in the world away\\nfrom him, this letter was not the most easy of letters to write. But\\nshe had made the language very kind. Yes; it was a thoroughly kind\\ncommunication. And all because of that momentary visit, when he had\\nbrought back to her two novels, EMMA and PRIDE AND PREJUDICE.\\n\\n“How do you like them?” she had then inquired; and he had smiled slowly\\nat her. “You haven't read them!” she exclaimed.\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Are you going to tell me there has been no time?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\nThen Molly had scolded her cow-puncher, and to this he had listened with\\npleasure undisguised, as indeed he listened to every word that she said.\\n\\n“Why, it has come too late,” he had told her when the scolding was over.\\n“If I was one of your little scholars hyeh in Bear Creek schoolhouse,\\nyu' could learn me to like such frillery I reckon. But I'm a mighty\\nignorant, growed-up man.”\\n\\n“So much the worse for you!” said Molly.\\n\\n“No. I am pretty glad I am a man. Else I could not have learned the\\nthing you have taught me.”\\n\\nBut she shut her lips and looked away. On the desk was a letter written\\nfrom Vermont. “If you don't tell me at once when you decide,” had said\\nthe arch writer, “never hope to speak to me again. Mary Wood, seriously,\\nI am suspicious. Why do you never mention him nowadays? How exciting\\nto have you bring a live cow-boy to Bennington! We should all come\\nto dinner. Though of course I understand now that many of them have\\nexcellent manners. But would he wear his pistol at table?” So the letter\\nran on. It recounted the latest home gossip and jokes. In answering it\\nMolly Wood had taken no notice of its childish tone here and there.\\n\\n“Hyeh's some of them cactus blossoms yu' wanted,” said the Virginian.\\nHis voice recalled the girl with almost a start. “I've brought a good\\nhawss I've gentled for yu', and Taylor'll keep him till I need him.”\\n\\n“Thank you so much! but I wish--”\\n\\n“I reckon yu' can't stop me lendin' Taylor a hawss. And you cert'nly'll\\nget sick schoolteachin' if yu' don't keep outdoors some. Good-by--till\\nthat next time.”\\n\\n“Yes; there's always a next time,” she answered, as lightly as she\\ncould.\\n\\n“There always will be. Don't yu' know that?”\\n\\nShe did not reply.\\n\\n“I have discouraged spells,” he pursued, “but I down them. For I've told\\nyu' you were going to love me. You are goin' to learn back the thing you\\nhave taught me. I'm not askin' anything now; I don't want you to speak a\\nword to me. But I'm never goin' to quit till 'next time' is no more, and\\nit's 'all the time' for you and me.”\\n\\nWith that he had ridden away, not even touching her hand. Long after\\nhe had gone she was still in her chair, her eyes lingering upon his\\nflowers, those yellow cups of the prickly pear. At length she had\\nrisen impatiently, caught up the flowers, gone with them to the open\\nwindow,--and then, after all, set them with pains in water.\\n\\nBut to-day Bear Creek was over. She was going home now. By the week's\\nend she would be started. By the time the mail brought him her good-by\\nletter she would be gone. She had acted.\\n\\nTo Bear Creek, the neighborly, the friendly, the not comprehending, this\\nmove had come unlooked for, and had brought regret. Only one hard word\\nhad been spoken to Molly, and that by her next-door neighbor and kindest\\nfriend. In Mrs. Taylor's house the girl had daily come and gone as\\na daughter, and that lady reached the subject thus:-- “When I took\\nTaylor,” said she, sitting by as Robert Browning and Jane Austen were\\ngoing into their box, “I married for love.”\\n\\n“Do you wish it had been money?” said Molly, stooping to her industries.\\n\\n“You know both of us better than that, child.”\\n\\n“I know I've seen people at home who couldn't possibly have had any\\nother reason. They seemed satisfied, too.”\\n\\n“Maybe the poor ignorant things were!”\\n\\n“And so I have never been sure how I might choose.”\\n\\n“Yes, you are sure, deary. Don't you think I know you? And when it comes\\nover Taylor once in a while, and he tells me I'm the best thing in his\\nlife, and I tell him he ain't merely the best thing but the only thing\\nin mine,--him and the children,--why, we just agree we'd do it all over\\nthe same way if we had the chance.”\\n\\nMolly continued to be industrious.\\n\\n“And that's why,” said Mrs. Taylor, “I want every girl that's anything\\nto me to know her luck when it comes. For I was that near telling Taylor\\nI wouldn't!”\\n\\n“If ever my luck comes,” said Molly, with her back to her friend, “I\\nshall say 'I will' at once.”\\n\\n“Then you'll say it at Bennington next week.”\\n\\nMolly wheeled round.\\n\\n“Why, you surely will. Do you expect he's going to stay here, and you in\\nBennington?” And the campaigner sat back in her chair.\\n\\n“He? Goodness! Who is he?”\\n\\n“Child, child, you're talking cross to-day because you're at outs with\\nyourself. You've been at outs ever since you took this idea of leaving\\nthe school and us and everything this needless way. You have not treated\\nhim right. And why, I can't make out to save me. What have you found out\\nall of a sudden? If he was not good enough for you, I--But, oh, it's a\\nprime one you're losing, Molly. When a man like that stays faithful to a\\ngirl 'spite all the chances he gets, her luck is come.”\\n\\n“Oh, my luck! People have different notions of luck.”\\n\\n“Notions!”\\n\\n“He has been very kind.”\\n\\n“Kind!” And now without further simmering, Mrs. Taylor's wrath boiled\\nup and poured copiously over Molly Wood. “Kind! There's a word you\\nshouldn't use, my dear. No doubt you can spell it. But more than its\\nspelling I guess you don't know. The children can learn what it means\\nfrom some of the rest of us folks that don't spell so correct, maybe.”\\n\\n“Mrs. Taylor, Mrs. Taylor--”\\n\\n“I can't wait, deary. Since the roughness looks bigger to you than the\\ndiamond, you had better go back to Vermont. I expect you'll find better\\ngrammar there, deary.”\\n\\nThe good dame stalked out, and across to her own cabin, and left the\\nangry girl among her boxes. It was in vain she fell to work upon them.\\nPresently something had to be done over again, and when it was the box\\nheld several chattels less than before the readjustment. She played a\\nsort of desperate dominos to fit these objects in the space, but here\\nwere a paper-weight, a portfolio, with two wretched volumes that no\\nchink would harbor; and letting them fall all at once, she straightened\\nherself, still stormy with revolt, eyes and cheeks still hot from\\nthe sting of long-parried truth. There, on her wall still, was the\\nminiature, the little silent ancestress; and upon this face the girl's\\nglance rested. It was as if she appealed to Grandmother Stark for\\nsupport and comfort across the hundred years which lay between them. So\\nthe flaxen girl on the wall and she among the boxes stood a moment face\\nto face in seeming communion, and then the descendant turned again to\\nher work. But after a desultory touch here and there she drew a long\\nbreath and walked to the open door. What use was in finishing to-day,\\nwhen she had nearly a week? This first spurt of toil had swept the cabin\\nbare of all indwelling charm, and its look was chill. Across the lane\\nhis horse, the one he had “gentled” for her, was grazing idly. She\\nwalked there and caught him, and led him to her gate. Mrs. Taylor saw\\nher go in, and soon come out in riding-dress; and she watched the girl\\nthrow the saddle on with quick ease--the ease he had taught her. Mrs.\\nTaylor also saw the sharp cut she gave the horse, and laughed grimly\\nto herself in her window as horse and rider galloped into the beautiful\\nsunny loneliness.\\n\\nTo the punished animal this switching was new! and at its third\\nrepetition he turned his head in surprise, but was no more heeded than\\nwere the bluffs and flowers where he was taking his own undirected\\nchoice of way. He carried her over ground she knew by heart--Corncliff\\nMesa, Crowheart Butte, Westfall's Crossing, Upper Canyon; open land and\\nwoodland, pines and sage-brush, all silent and grave and lustrous in the\\nsunshine. Once and again a ranchman greeted her, and wondered if she\\nhad forgotten who he was; once she passed some cow-punchers with a small\\nherd of steers, and they stared after her too. Bear Creek narrowed, its\\nmountain-sides drew near, its little falls began to rush white in midday\\nshadow, and the horse suddenly pricked his ears. Unguided, he was taking\\nthis advantage to go home. Though he had made but little way--a mere\\nbeginning yet--on this trail over to Sunk Creek, here was already a\\nSunk Creek friend whinnying good day to him, so he whinnied back and\\nquickened his pace, and Molly started to life. What was Monte doing\\nhere? She saw the black horse she knew also, saddled, with reins\\ndragging on the trail as the rider had dropped them to dismount. A cold\\nspring bubbled out beyond the next rock, and she knew her lover's horse\\nwas waiting for him while he drank. She pulled at the reins, but loosed\\nthem, for to turn and escape now was ridiculous; and riding boldly round\\nthe rock, she came upon him by the spring. One of his arms hung up to\\nits elbow in the pool, the other was crooked beside his head, but the\\nface was sunk downward against the shelving rock, so that she saw only\\nhis black, tangled hair. As her horse snorted and tossed his head she\\nlooked swiftly at Monte, as if to question him. Seeing now the sweat\\nmatted on his coat, and noting the white rim of his eye, she sprang and\\nran to the motionless figure. A patch of blood at his shoulder behind\\nstained the soft flannel shirt, spreading down beneath his belt, and the\\nman's whole strong body lay slack and pitifully helpless.\\n\\nShe touched the hand beside his head, but it seemed neither warm nor\\ncold to her; she felt for the pulse, as nearly as she could remember the\\ndoctors did, but could not tell whether she imagined or not that it was\\nstill; twice with painful care her fingers sought and waited for the\\nbeat, and her face seemed like one of listening. She leaned down and\\nlifted his other arm and hand from the water, and as their ice-coldness\\nreached her senses, clearly she saw the patch near the shoulder she\\nhad moved grow wet with new blood, and at that sight she grasped at the\\nstones upon which she herself now sank. She held tight by two rocks,\\nsitting straight beside him, staring, and murmuring aloud, “I must\\nnot faint; I will not faint;” and the standing horses looked at her,\\npricking their ears.\\n\\nIn this cup-like spread of the ravine the sun shone warmly down, the\\ntall red cliff was warm, the pines were a warm film and filter of green;\\noutside the shade across Bear Creek rose the steep, soft, open yellow\\nhill, warm and high to the blue, and Bear Creek tumbled upon its\\nsunsparkling stones. The two horses on the margin trail still looked\\nat the spring and trees, where sat the neat flaxen girl so rigid by the\\nslack prone body in its flannel shirt and leathern chaps. Suddenly her\\nface livened. “But the blood ran!” she exclaimed, as if to the horses,\\nher companions in this. She moved to him, and put her hand in through\\nhis shirt against his heart.\\n\\nNext moment she had sprung up and was at his saddle, searching, then\\nswiftly went on to her own and got her small flask and was back beside\\nhim. Here was the cold water he had sought, and she put it against his\\nforehead and drenched the wounded shoulder with it. Three times she\\ntried to move him, so he might lie more easy, but his dead weight was\\ntoo much, and desisting, she sat close and raised his head to let it\\nrest against her. Thus she saw the blood that was running from in front\\nof the shoulder also; but she said no more about fainting. She tore\\nstrips from her dress and soaked them, keeping them cold and wet upon\\nboth openings of his wound, and she drew her pocket-knife out and cut\\nhis shirt away from the place. As she continually rinsed and cleaned\\nit, she watched his eyelashes, long and soft and thick, but they did not\\nstir. Again she tried the flask, but failed from being still too gentle,\\nand her searching eyes fell upon ashes near the pool. Still undispersed\\nby the weather lay the small charred ends of a fire he and she had made\\nonce here together, to boil coffee and fry trout. She built another fire\\nnow, and when the flames were going well, filled her flask-cup from the\\nspring and set it to heat. Meanwhile, she returned to nurse his head\\nand wound. Her cold water had stopped the bleeding. Then she poured\\nher brandy in the steaming cup, and, made rough by her desperate\\nhelplessness, forced some between his lips and teeth.\\n\\nInstantly, almost, she felt the tremble of life creeping back, and\\nas his deep eyes opened upon her she sat still and mute. But the gaze\\nseemed luminous with an unnoting calm, and she wondered if perhaps he\\ncould not recognize her; she watched this internal clearness of his\\nvision, scarcely daring to breathe, until presently he began to speak,\\nwith the same profound and clear impersonality sounding in his slowly\\nuttered words.\\n\\n“I thought they had found me. I expected they were going to kill me.”\\n He stopped, and she gave him more of the hot drink, which he took, still\\nlying and looking at her as if the present did not reach his senses. “I\\nknew hands were touching me. I reckon I was not dead. I knew about them\\nsoon as they began, only I could not interfere.” He waited again. “It is\\nmighty strange where I have been. No. Mighty natural.” Then he went back\\ninto his revery, and lay with his eyes still full open upon her where\\nshe sat motionless.\\n\\nShe began to feel a greater awe in this living presence than when it\\nhad been his body with an ice-cold hand; and she quietly spoke his name,\\nventuring scarcely more than a whisper.\\n\\nAt this, some nearer thing wakened in his look. “But it was you all\\nalong,” he resumed. “It is you now. You must not stay--” Weakness\\novercame him, and his eyes closed. She sat ministering to him, and when\\nhe roused again, he began anxiously at once: “You must not stay. They\\nwould get you, too.”\\n\\nShe glanced at him with a sort of fierceness, then reached for his\\npistol, in which was nothing but blackened empty cartridges. She threw\\nthese out and drew six from his belt, loaded the weapon, and snapped\\nshut its hinge.\\n\\n“Please take it,” he said, more anxious and more himself. “I ain't worth\\ntryin' to keep. Look at me!”\\n\\n“Are you giving up?” she inquired, trying to put scorn in her tone. Then\\nshe seated herself.\\n\\n“Where is the sense in both of us--”\\n\\n“You had better save your strength,” she interrupted.\\n\\nHe tried to sit up.\\n\\n“Lie down!” she ordered.\\n\\nHe sank obediently, and began to smile.\\n\\nWhen she saw that, she smiled too, and unexpectedly took his hand.\\n“Listen, friend,” said she. “Nobody shall get you, and nobody shall get\\nme. Now take some more brandy.”\\n\\n“It must be noon,” said the cow-puncher, when she had drawn her hand\\naway from him. “I remember it was dark when--when--when I can remember.\\nI reckon they were scared to follow me in so close to settlers. Else\\nthey would have been here.”\\n\\n“You must rest,” she observed.\\n\\nShe broke the soft ends of some evergreen, and putting them beneath his\\nhead, went to the horses, loosened the cinches, took off the bridles,\\nled them to drink, and picketed them to feed. Further still, to leave\\nnothing undone which she could herself manage, she took the horses'\\nsaddles off to refold the blankets when the time should come, and\\nmeanwhile brought them for him. But he put them away from him. He was\\nsitting up against a rock, stronger evidently, and asking for cold\\nwater. His head was fire-hot, and the paleness beneath his swarthy skin\\nhad changed to a deepening flush.\\n\\n“Only five miles!” she said to him, bathing his head.\\n\\n“Yes. I must hold it steady,” he answered, waving his hand at the cliff.\\n\\nShe told him to try and keep it steady until they got home.\\n\\n“Yes,” he repeated. “Only five miles. But it's fightin' to turn around.”\\n Half aware that he was becoming light-headed, he looked from the rock to\\nher and from her to the rock with dilating eyes.\\n\\n“We can hold it together,” she said. “You must get on your horse.” She\\ntook his handkerchief from round his neck, knotting it with her own, and\\nto make more bandage she ran to the roll of clothes behind his saddle\\nand tore in halves a clean shirt. A handkerchief fell from it, which\\nshe seized also, and opening, saw her own initials by the hem. Then she\\nremembered: she saw again their first meeting, the swollen river, the\\noverset stage, the unknown horseman who carried her to the bank on his\\nsaddle and went away unthanked--her whole first adventure on that\\nfirst day of her coming to this new country--and now she knew how her\\nlong-forgotten handkerchief had gone that day. She refolded it gently\\nand put it back in his bundle, for there was enough bandage without it.\\nShe said not a word to him, and he placed a wrong meaning upon the look\\nwhich she gave him as she returned to bind his shoulder.\\n\\n“It don't hurt so much,” he assured her (though extreme pain was\\nclearing his head for the moment, and he had been able to hold the cliff\\nfrom turning). “Yu' must not squander your pity.”\\n\\n“Do not squander your strength,” said she.\\n\\n“Oh, I could put up a pretty good fight now!” But he tottered in showing\\nher how strong he was, and she told him that, after all, he was a child\\nstill.\\n\\n“Yes,” he slowly said, looking after her as she went to bring his horse,\\n“the same child that wanted to touch the moon, I guess.” And during the\\nslow climb down into the saddle from a rock to which she helped him he\\nsaid, “You have got to be the man all through this mess.”\\n\\nShe saw his teeth clinched and his drooping muscles compelled by will;\\nand as he rode and she walked to lend him support, leading her horse\\nby a backward-stretched left hand, she counted off the distance to him\\ncontinually--the increasing gain, the lessening road, the landmarks\\nnearing and dropping behind; here was the tree with the wasp-nest gone;\\nnow the burned cabin was passed; now the cottonwoods at the ford were in\\nsight. He was silent, and held to the saddle-horn, leaning more and more\\nagainst his two hands clasped over it; and just after they had made the\\ncrossing he fell, without a sound slipping to the grass, and his descent\\nbroken by her. But it started the blood a little, and she dared not\\nleave him to seek help. She gave him the last of the flask and all the\\nwater he craved.\\n\\nRevived, he managed to smile. “Yu' see, I ain't worth keeping.”\\n\\n“It's only a mile,” said she. So she found a log, a fallen trunk, and he\\ncrawled to that, and from there crawled to his saddle, and she marched\\non with him, talking, bidding him note the steps accomplished. For the\\nnext half-mile they went thus, the silent man clinched on the horse, and\\nby his side the girl walking and cheering him forward, when suddenly he\\nbegan to speak:-- “I will say good-by to you now, ma'am.”\\n\\nShe did not understand, at first, the significance of this.\\n\\n“He is getting away,” pursued the Virginian. “I must ask you to excuse\\nme, ma'am.”\\n\\nIt was a long while since her lord had addressed her as “ma'am.” As she\\nlooked at him in growing apprehension, he turned Monte and would have\\nridden away, but she caught the bridle.\\n\\n“You must take me home,” said she, with ready inspiration. “I am afraid\\nof the Indians.”\\n\\n“Why, you--why, they've all gone. There he goes. Ma'am--that hawss--”\\n\\n“No,” said she, holding firmly his rein and quickening her step. “A\\ngentleman does not invite a lady to go out riding and leave her.”\\n\\nHis eyes lost their purpose. “I'll cert'nly take you home. That sorrel\\nhas gone in there by the wallow, and Judge Henry will understand.” With\\nhis eyes watching imaginary objects, he rode and rambled and it was now\\nthe girl who was silent, except to keep his mind from its half-fixed\\nidea of the sorrel. As he grew more fluent she hastened still more,\\nlistening to head off that notion of return, skilfully inventing\\nquestions to engage him, so that when she brought him to her gate\\nshe held him in a manner subjected, answering faithfully the shrewd\\nunrealities which she devised, whatever makeshifts she could summon to\\nher mind; and next she had got him inside her dwelling and set him down\\ndocile, but now completely wandering; and then--no help was at hand,\\neven here. She had made sure of aid from next door, and there she\\nhastened, to find the Taylor's cabin locked and silent; and this meant\\nthat parents and children were gone to drive; nor might she be luckier\\nat her next nearest neighbors', should she travel the intervening mile\\nto fetch them. With a mind jostled once more into uncertainty, she\\nreturned to her room, and saw a change in him already. Illness had\\nstridden upon him; his face was not as she had left it, and the whole\\nbody, the splendid supple horseman, showed sickness in every line\\nand limb, its spurs and pistol and bold leather chaps a mockery of\\ntrappings. She looked at him, and decision came back to her, clear and\\nsteady. She supported him over to her bed and laid him on it. His head\\nsank flat, and his loose, nerveless arms stayed as she left them. Then\\namong her packing-boxes and beneath the little miniature, blue and\\nflaxen and gold upon its lonely wall, she undressed him. He was cold,\\nand she covered him to the face, and arranged the pillow, and got from\\nits box her scarlet and black Navajo blanket and spread it over him.\\nThere was no more that she could do, and she sat down by him to wait.\\nAmong the many and many things that came into her mind was a word he\\nsaid to her lightly a long while ago. “Cow-punchers do not live long\\nenough to get old,” he had told her. And now she looked at the head upon\\nthe pillow, grave and strong, but still the head of splendid, unworn\\nyouth.\\n\\nAt the distant jingle of the wagon in the lane she was out, and had met\\nher returning neighbors midway. They heard her with amazement, and came\\nin haste to the bedside; then Taylor departed to spread news of the\\nIndians and bring the doctor, twenty-five miles away. The two women\\nfriends stood alone again, as they had stood in the morning when anger\\nhad been between them.\\n\\n“Kiss me, deary,” said Mrs. Taylor. “Now I will look after him--and\\nyou'll need some looking after yourself.”\\n\\nBut on returning from her cabin with what store she possessed of lint\\nand stimulants, she encountered a rebel, independent as ever. Molly\\nwould hear no talk about saving her strength, would not be in any room\\nbut this one until the doctor should arrive; then perhaps it would be\\ntime to think about resting. So together the dame and the girl rinsed\\nthe man's wound and wrapped him in clean things, and did all the little\\nthat they knew--which was, in truth, the very thing needed. Then they\\nsat watching him toss and mutter. It was no longer upon Indians or\\nthe sorrel horse that his talk seemed to run, or anything recent,\\napparently, always excepting his work. This flowingly merged with\\nwhatever scene he was inventing or living again, and he wandered\\nunendingly in that incompatible world we dream in. Through the medley of\\nevents and names, often thickly spoken, but rising at times to grotesque\\ncoherence, the listeners now and then could piece out the reference from\\ntheir own knowledge. “Monte,” for example, continually addressed, and\\nMolly heard her own name, but invariably as “Miss Wood”; nothing less\\nrespectful came out, and frequently he answered some one as “ma'am.”\\n At these fragments of revelation Mrs. Taylor abstained from speech, but\\neyed Molly Wood with caustic reproach. As the night wore on, short lulls\\nof silence intervened, and the watchers were deceived into hope that the\\nfever was abating. And when the Virginian sat quietly up in bed, essayed\\nto move his bandage, and looked steadily at Mrs. Taylor, she rose\\nquickly and went to him with a question as to how he was doing.\\n\\n“Rise on your laigs, you polecat,” said he, “and tell them you're a\\nliar.”\\n\\nThe good dame gasped, then bade him lie down, and he obeyed her with\\nthat strange double understanding of the delirious; for even while\\nsubmitting, he muttered “liar,” “polecat,” and then “Trampas.”\\n\\nAt that name light flashed on Mrs. Taylor, and she turned to Molly; and\\nthere was the girl struggling with a fit of mirth at his speech; but the\\nlaughter was fast becoming a painful seizure. Mrs. Taylor walked Molly\\nup and down, speaking mmediately to arrest her attention.\\n\\n“You might as well know it,” she said. “He would blame me for speaking\\nof it, but where's the harm all this while after? And you would never\\nhear it from his mouth. Molly, child, they say Trampas would kill him if\\nhe dared, and that's on account of you.”\\n\\n“I never saw Trampas,” said Molly, fixing her eyes upon the speaker.\\n\\n“No, deary. But before a lot of men--Taylor has told me about\\nit--Trampas spoke disrespectfully of you, and before them all he made\\nTrampas say he was a liar. That is what he did when you were almost\\na stranger among us, and he had not started seeing so much of you. I\\nexpect Trampas is the only enemy he ever had in this country. But he\\nwould never let you know about that.”\\n\\n“No,” whispered Molly; “I did not know.”\\n\\n“Steve!” the sick man now cried out, in poignant appeal. “Steve!” To the\\nwomen it was a name unknown,--unknown as was also this deep inward tide\\nof feeling which he could no longer conceal, being himself no longer.\\n“No, Steve,” he said next, and muttering followed. “It ain't so!” he\\nshouted; and then cunningly in a lowered voice, “Steve, I have lied for\\nyou.”\\n\\nIn time Mrs. Taylor spoke some advice.\\n\\n“You had better go to bed, child. You look about ready for the doctor\\nyourself.”\\n\\n“Then I will wait for him,” said Molly.\\n\\nSo the two nurses continued to sit until darkness at the windows\\nweakened into gray, and the lamp was no more needed. Their patient was\\nrambling again. Yet, into whatever scenes he went, there in some guise\\ndid the throb of his pain evidently follow him, and he lay hitching his\\ngreat shoulder as if to rid it of the cumbrance. They waited for the\\ndoctor, not daring much more than to turn pillows and give what other\\nease they could; and then, instead of the doctor, came a messenger,\\nabout noon, to say he was gone on a visit some thirty miles beyond,\\nwhere Taylor had followed to bring him here as soon as might be. At this\\nMolly consented to rest and to watch, turn about; and once she was over\\nin her friend's house lying down, they tried to keep her there. But the\\nrevolutionist could not be put down, and when, as a last pretext, Mrs.\\nTaylor urged the proprieties and conventions, the pale girl from Vermont\\nlaughed sweetly in her face and returned to sit by the sick man. With\\nthe approach of the second night his fever seemed to rise and master\\nhim more completely than they had yet seen it, and presently it so raged\\nthat the women called in stronger arms to hold him down. There were\\ntimes when he broke out in the language of the round-up, and Mrs. Taylor\\nrenewed her protests. “Why,” said Molly, “don't you suppose I knew they\\ncould swear?” So the dame, in deepening astonishment and affection, gave\\nup these shifts at decorum. Nor did the delirium run into the intimate,\\ncoarse matters that she dreaded. The cow-puncher had lived like his\\nkind, but his natural daily thoughts were clean, and came from the\\nuntamed but unstained mind of a man. And toward morning, as Mrs. Taylor\\nsat taking her turn, suddenly he asked had he been sick long, and looked\\nat her with a quieted eye. The wandering seemed to drop from him at a\\nstroke, leaving him altogether himself. He lay very feeble, and inquired\\nonce or twice of his state and how he came here; nor was anything left\\nin his memory of even coming to the spring where he had been found.\\n\\nWhen the doctor arrived, he pronounced that it would be long--or very\\nshort. He praised their clean water treatment; the wound was fortunately\\nwell up on the shoulder, and gave so far no bad signs; there were not\\nany bad signs; and the blood and strength of the patient had been as\\nfew men's were; each hour was now an hour nearer certainty, and\\nmeanwhile--meanwhile the doctor would remain as long as he could. He had\\nmany inquiries to satisfy. Dusty fellows would ride up, listen to him,\\nand reply, as they rode away, “Don't yu' let him die, Doc.” And Judge\\nHenry sent over from Sunk Creek to answer for any attendance or medicine\\nthat might help his foreman. The country was moved with concern and\\ninterest; and in Molly's ears its words of good feeling seemed to unite\\nand sum up a burden, “Don't yu' let him die, Doc.” The Indians who had\\ndone this were now in military custody. They had come unpermitted from\\na southern reservation, hunting, next thieving, and as the slumbering\\nspirit roused in one or two of the young and ambitious, they had\\nventured this in the secret mountains, and perhaps had killed a trapper\\nfound there. Editors immediately reared a tall war out of it; but from\\nfive Indians in a guard-house waiting punishment not even an editor\\ncan supply spar for more than two editions, and if the recent alarm\\nwas still a matter of talk anywhere, it was not here in the sick-room.\\nWhichever way the case should turn, it was through Molly alone (the\\ndoctor told her) that the wounded man had got this chance--this good\\nchance, he related.\\n\\nAnd he told her she had not done a woman's part, but a man's part, and\\nnow had no more to do; no more till the patient got well, and could\\nthank her in his own way, said the doctor, smiling, and supposing things\\nthat were not so--misled perhaps by Mrs. Taylor.\\n\\n“I'm afraid I'll be gone by the time he is well,” said Molly, coldly;\\nand the discreet physician said ah, and that she would find Bennington\\nquite a change from Bear Creek.\\n\\nBut Mrs. Taylor spoke otherwise, and at that the girl said: “I shall\\nstay as long as I am needed. I will nurse him. I want to nurse him. I\\nwill do everything for him that I can!” she exclaimed, with force.\\n\\n“And that won't be anything, deary,” said Mrs. Taylor, harshly. “A year\\nof nursing don't equal a day of sweetheart.”\\n\\nThe girl took a walk,--she was of no more service in the room at\\npresent,--but she turned without going far, and Mrs. Taylor spied her\\ncome to lean over the pasture fence and watch the two horses--that one\\nthe Virginian had “gentled” for her, and his own Monte. During this\\nsuspense came a new call for the doctor, neighbors profiting by his\\nvisit to Bear Creek; and in his going away to them, even under promise\\nof quick return, Mrs. Taylor suspected a favorable sign. He kept his\\nword as punctually as had been possible, arriving after some six hours\\nwith a confident face, and spending now upon the patient a care not\\nneeded, save to reassure the bystanders. He spoke his opinion that all\\nwas even better than he could have hoped it would be, so soon. Here was\\nnow the beginning of the fifth day; the wound's look was wholesome, no\\nfurther delirium had come, and the fever had abated a degree while he\\nwas absent. He believed the serious danger-line lay behind, and (short\\nof the unforeseen) the man's deep untainted strength would reassert\\nits control. He had much blood to make, and must be cared for during\\nweeks--three, four, five--there was no saying how long yet. These next\\nfew days it must be utter quiet for him; he must not talk nor hear\\nanything likely to disturb him; and then the time for cheerfulness and\\ngradual company would come--sooner than later, the doctor hoped. So\\nhe departed, and sent next day some bottles, with further cautions\\nregarding the wound and dirt, and to say he should be calling the day\\nafter to-morrow.\\n\\nUpon that occasion he found two patients. Molly Wood lay in bed at Mrs.\\nTaylor's, filled with apology and indignation. With little to do, and\\ndeprived of the strong stimulant of anxiety and action, her strength\\nhad quite suddenly left her, so that she had spoken only in a sort of\\nwhisper. But upon waking from a long sleep, after Mrs. Taylor had taken\\nher firmly, almost severely, in hand, her natural voice had returned,\\nand now the chief treatment the doctor gave her was a sort of scolding,\\nwhich it pleased Mrs. Taylor to hear. The doctor even dropped a phrase\\nconcerning the arrogance of strong nerves in slender bodies, and of\\nundertaking several people's work when several people were at hand to do\\nit for themselves, and this pleased Mrs. Taylor remarkably. As for the\\nwounded man, he was behaving himself properly. Perhaps in another week\\nhe could be moved to a more cheerful room. Just now, with cleanliness\\nand pure air, any barn would do.\\n\\n“We are real lucky to have such a sensible doctor in the country,” Mrs.\\nTaylor observed, after the physician had gone.\\n\\n“No doubt,” said Molly. “He said my room was a barn.”\\n\\n“That's what you've made it, deary. But sick men don't notice much.”\\n\\nNevertheless, one may believe, without going widely astray, that\\nillness, so far from veiling, more often quickens the perceptions--at\\nany rate those of the naturally keen. On a later day--and the interval\\nwas brief--while Molly was on her second drive to take the air with Mrs.\\nTaylor, that lady informed her that the sick man had noticed. “And I\\ncould not tell him things liable to disturb him,” said she, “and so\\nI--well, I expect I just didn't exactly tell him the facts. I said yes,\\nyou were packing up for a little visit to your folks. They had not seen\\nyou for quite a while, I said. And he looked at those boxes kind of\\nsilent like.”\\n\\n“There's no need to move him,” said Molly. '“It is simpler to move\\nthem--the boxes. I could take out some of my things, you know, just\\nwhile he has to be kept there. I mean--you see, if the doctor says the\\nroom should be cheerful--”\\n\\n“Yes, deary.”\\n\\n“I will ask the doctor next time,” said Molly, “if he believes I\\nam--competent to spread a rug upon a floor.” Molly's references to\\nthe doctor were usually acid these days. And this he totally failed to\\nobserve, telling her when he came, why, to be sure! the very thing!\\nAnd if she could play cards or read aloud, or afford any other light\\ndistractions, provided they did not lead the patient to talk and tire\\nhimself, that she would be most useful. Accordingly she took over the\\ncribbage board, and came with unexpected hesitation face to face again\\nwith the swarthy man she had saved and tended. He was not so swarthy\\nnow, but neat, with chin clean, and hair and mustache trimmed and\\nsmooth, and he sat propped among pillows watching for her.\\n\\n“You are better,” she said, speaking first, and with uncertain voice.\\n\\n“Yes. They have given me awdehs not to talk,” said the Southerner,\\nsmiling.\\n\\n“Oh, yes. Please do not talk--not to-day.”\\n\\n“No. Only this”--he looked at her, and saw her seem to shrink--“thank\\nyou for what you have done,” he said simply.\\n\\nShe took tenderly the hand he stretched to her; and upon these terms\\nthey set to work at cribbage. She won, and won again, and the third time\\nlaid down her cards and reproached him with playing in order to lose.\\n\\n“No,” he said, and his eye wandered to the boxes. “But my thoughts get\\naway from me. I'll be strong enough to hold them on the cyards next\\ntime, I reckon.”\\n\\nMany tones in his voice she had heard, but never the tone of sadness\\nuntil to-day.\\n\\nThen they played a little more, and she put away the board for this\\nfirst time.\\n\\n“You are going now?” he asked.\\n\\n“When I have made this room look a little less forlorn. They haven't\\nwanted to meddle with my things, I suppose.” And Molly stooped once\\nagain among the chattels destined for Vermont. Out they came; again the\\nbearskin was spread on the floor, various possessions and ornaments went\\nback into their ancient niches, the shelves grew comfortable with books,\\nand, last, some flowers were stood on the table.\\n\\n“More like old times,” said the Virginian, but sadly.\\n\\n“It's too bad,” said Molly, “you had to be brought into such a looking\\nplace.”\\n\\n“And your folks waiting for you,” said he.\\n\\n“Oh, I'll pay my visit later,” said Molly, putting the rug a trifle\\nstraighter.\\n\\n“May I ask one thing?” pleaded the Virginian, and at the gentleness of\\nhis voice her face grew rosy, and she fixed her eyes on him with a sort\\nof dread.\\n\\n“Anything that I can answer,” said she.\\n\\n“Oh, yes. Did I tell yu' to quit me, and did yu' load up my gun and\\nstay? Was that a real business? I have been mixed up in my haid.”\\n\\n“That was real,” said Molly. “What else was there to do?”\\n\\n“Just nothing--for such as you!” he exclaimed. “My haid has been mighty\\ncrazy; and that little grandmother of yours yondeh, she--but I can't\\njust quite catch a-hold of these things”--he passed a hand over\\nhis forehead--“so many--or else one right along--well, it's all\\nfoolishness!” he concluded, with something almost savage in his tone.\\nAnd after she had gone from the cabin he lay very still, looking at the\\nminiature on the wall.\\n\\nHe was in another sort of mood the next time, cribbage not interesting\\nhim in the least. “Your folks will be wondering about you,” said he.\\n\\n“I don't think they will mind which month I go to them,” said Molly.\\n“Especially when they know the reason.”\\n\\n“Don't let me keep you, ma'am,” said he. Molly stared at him; but he\\npursued, with the same edge lurking in his slow words: “Though I'll\\nnever forget. How could I forget any of all you have done--and been? If\\nthere had been none of this, why, I had enough to remember! But please\\ndon't stay, ma'am. We'll say I had a claim when yu' found me pretty well\\ndead, but I'm gettin' well, yu' see--right smart, too!”\\n\\n“I can't understand, indeed I can't,” said Molly, “why you're talking\\nso!”\\n\\nHe seemed to have certain moods when he would address her as “ma'am,”\\n and this she did not like, but could not prevent.\\n\\n“Oh, a sick man is funny. And yu' know I'm grateful to you.”\\n\\n“Please say no more about that, or I shall go this afternoon. I don't\\nwant to go. I am not ready. I think I had better read something now.”\\n\\n“Why, yes. That's cert'nly a good notion. Why, this is the best show\\nyou'll ever get to give me education. Won't yu' please try that EMMA\\nbook now, ma'am? Listening to you will be different.” This was said with\\nsoftness and humility.\\n\\nUncertain--as his gravity often left her--precisely what he meant by\\nwhat he said, Molly proceeded with EMMA, slackly at first, but soon with\\nthe enthusiasm that Miss Austen invariably gave her. She held the volume\\nand read away at it, commenting briefly, and then, finishing a chapter\\nof the sprightly classic, found her pupil slumbering peacefully. There\\nwas no uncertainty about that.\\n\\n“You couldn't be doing a healthier thing for him, deary,” said Mrs.\\nTaylor. “If it gets to make him wakeful, try something harder.” This was\\nthe lady's scarcely sympathetic view.\\n\\nBut it turned out to be not obscurity in which Miss Austen sinned.\\n\\nWhen Molly next appeared at the Virginian's threshold, he said\\nplaintively, “I reckon I am a dunce.” And he sued for pardon. “When I\\nwaked up,” he said, “I was ashamed of myself for a plumb half-hour.” Nor\\ncould she doubt this day that he meant what he said. His mood was again\\nserene and gentle, and without referring to his singular words that had\\ndistressed her, he made her feel his contrition, even in his silence.\\n\\n“I am right glad you have come,” he said. And as he saw her going to the\\nbookshelf, he continued, with diffidence: “As regyards that EMMA book,\\nyu' see--yu' see, the doin's and sayin's of folks like them are above\\nme. But I think” (he spoke most diffidently), “if yu' could read me\\nsomething that was ABOUT something, I--I'd be liable to keep awake.” And\\nhe smiled with a certain shyness.\\n\\n“Something ABOUT something?” queried Molly, at a loss.\\n\\n“Why, yes. Shakespeare. HENRY THE FOURTH. The British king is fighting,\\nand there is his son the prince. He cert'nly must have been a jim-dandy\\nboy if that is all true. Only he would go around town with a mighty\\ntriflin' gang. They sported and they held up citizens. And his father\\nhated his travelling with trash like them. It was right natural--the boy\\nand the old man! But the boy showed himself a man too. He killed a big\\nfighter on the other side who was another jim-dandy--and he was sorry\\nfor having it to do.” The Virginian warmed to his recital. “I understand\\nmost all of that. There was a fat man kept everybody laughing. He was\\nawful natural too; except yu' don't commonly meet 'em so fat. But the\\nprince--that play is bed-rock, ma'am! Have you got something like that?”\\n\\n“Yes, I think so,” she replied. “I believe I see what you would\\nappreciate.”\\n\\nShe took her Browning, her idol, her imagined affinity. For the pale\\ndecadence of New England had somewhat watered her good old Revolutionary\\nblood too, and she was inclined to think under glass and to live\\nunderdone--when there were no Indians to shoot! She would have joyed to\\nventure “Paracelsus” on him, and some lengthy rhymed discourses; and she\\nfondly turned leaves and leaves of her pet doggerel analytics. “Pippa\\nPasses” and others she had to skip, from discreet motives--pages which\\nhe would have doubtless stayed awake at; but she chose a poem at length.\\nThis was better than Emma, he pronounced. And short. The horse was a\\ngood horse. He thought a man whose horse must not play out on him would\\nwatch the ground he was galloping over for holes, and not be likely to\\nsee what color the rims of his animal's eye-sockets were. You could not\\nsee them if you sat as you ought to for such a hard ride. Of the next\\npiece that she read him he thought still better. “And it is short,” said\\nhe. “But the last part drops.”\\n\\nMolly instantly exacted particulars.\\n\\n“The soldier should not have told the general he was killed,” stated the\\ncow-puncher.\\n\\n“What should he have told him, I'd like to know?” said Molly.\\n\\n“Why, just nothing. If the soldier could ride out of the battle all shot\\nup, and tell his general about their takin' the town--that was being\\ngritty, yu' see. But that truck at the finish--will yu' please say it\\nagain?”\\n\\nSo Molly read:--\\n\\n    “'You're wounded! 'Nay,' the soldier's pride\\n     Touched to the quick, he said,\\n     'I'm killed, sire!' And, his chief beside,\\n     Smiling the boy fell dead.”\\n\\n“'Nay, I'm killed, sire,'” drawled the Virginian, amiably; for (symptom\\nof convalescence) his freakish irony was revived in him. “Now a man\\nwho was man enough to act like he did, yu' see, would fall dead without\\nmentioning it.”\\n\\nNone of Molly's sweet girl friends had ever thus challenged Mr.\\nBrowning. They had been wont to cluster over him with a joyous awe that\\ndeepened proportionally with their misunderstanding. Molly paused to\\nconsider this novelty of view about the soldier. “He was a Frenchman,\\nyou know,” she said, under inspiration.\\n\\n“A Frenchman,” murmured the grave cow-puncher. “I never knowed a\\nFrenchman, but I reckon they might perform that class of foolishness.”\\n\\n“But why was it foolish?” she cried.\\n\\n“His soldier's pride--don't you see?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\nMolly now burst into a luxury of discussion. She leaned toward her\\ncow-puncher with bright eyes searching his; with elbow on knee and hand\\npropping chin, her lap became a slant, and from it Browning the poet\\nslid and toppled, and lay unrescued. For the slow cow-puncher unfolded\\nhis notions of masculine courage and modesty (though he did not deal in\\nsuch high-sounding names), and Molly forgot everything to listen to him,\\nas he forgot himself and his inveterate shyness and grew talkative to\\nher. “I would never have supposed that!” she would exclaim as she heard\\nhim; or, presently again, “I never had such an idea!” And her mind\\nopened with delight to these new things which came from the man's mind\\nso simple and direct. To Browning they did come back, but the Virginian,\\nthough interested, conceived a dislike for him. “He is a smarty,” said\\nhe, once or twice.\\n\\n“Now here is something,” said Molly. “I have never known what to think.”\\n\\n“Oh, Heavens!” murmured the sick man, smiling. “Is it short?”\\n\\n“Very short. Now please attend.” And she read him twelve lines about\\na lover who rowed to a beach in the dusk, crossed a field, tapped at a\\npane, and was admitted.\\n\\n“That is the best yet,” said the Virginian. “There's only one thing yu'\\ncan think about that.”\\n\\n“But wait,” said the girl, swiftly. “Here is how they parted:--\\n\\n     “Round the cape of a sudden came the sea,\\n     And the sun looked over the mountain's rim--\\n     And straight was a path of gold for him,\\n     And the need of a world of men for me.”\\n\\n“That is very, very true,” murmured the Virginian, dropping his eyes\\nfrom the girl's intent ones.\\n\\n“Had they quarrelled?” she inquired.\\n\\n“Oh, no!”\\n\\n“But--”\\n\\n“I reckon he loved her very much.”\\n\\n“Then you're sure they hadn't quarrelled?”\\n\\n“Dead sure, ma'am. He would come back afteh he had played some more of\\nthe game.”\\n\\n“The game?”\\n\\n“Life, ma'am. Whatever he was a-doin' in the world of men. That's a\\nbed-rock piece, ma'am!”\\n\\n“Well, I don't see why you think it's so much better than some of the\\nothers.”\\n\\n“I could sca'cely explain,” answered the man. “But that writer does know\\nsomething.”\\n\\n“I am glad they hadn't quarrelled,” said Molly, thoughtfully. And she\\nbegan to like having her opinions refuted.\\n\\nHis bandages, becoming a little irksome, had to be shifted, and this\\nturned their discourse from literature to Wyoming; and Molly inquired,\\nhad he ever been shot before? Only once, he told her. “I have been\\nlucky in having few fusses,” said he. “I hate them. If a man has to be\\nkilled--”\\n\\n“You never--” broke in Molly. She had started back a little. “Well,” she\\nadded hastily, “don't tell me if--”\\n\\n“I shouldn't wonder if I got one of those Indians,” he said quietly.\\n“But I wasn't waitin' to see! But I came mighty near doing for a white\\nman that day. He had been hurtin' a hawss.”\\n\\n“Hurting?” said Molly.\\n\\n“Injurin.' I will not tell yu' about that. It would hurt yu' to hear\\nsuch things. But hawsses--don't they depend on us? Ain't they somethin'\\nlike children? I did not lay up the man very bad. He was able to travel\\n'most right away. Why, you'd have wanted to kill him yourself!”\\n\\nSo the Virginian talked, nor knew what he was doing to the girl. Nor\\nwas she aware of what she was receiving from him as he unwittingly spoke\\nhimself out to her in these Browning meetings they had each day. But\\nMrs. Taylor grew pleased. The kindly dame would sometimes cross the\\nroad to see if she were needed, and steal away again after a peep at the\\nwindow. There, inside, among the restored home treasures, sat the two:\\nthe rosy alert girl, sweet as she talked or read to him; and he, the\\ngrave, half-weak giant among his wraps, watching her.\\n\\nOf her delayed home visit he never again spoke, either to her or to Mrs.\\nTaylor; and Molly veered aside from any trend of talk she foresaw was\\nleading toward that subject. But in those hours when no visitors\\ncame, and he was by himself in the quiet, he would lie often sombrely\\ncontemplating the girl's room, her little dainty knickknacks, her home\\nphotographs, all the delicate manifestations of what she came from and\\nwhat she was. Strength was flowing back into him each day, and Judge\\nHenry's latest messenger had brought him clothes and mail from Sunk\\nCreek and many inquiries of kindness, and returned taking the news of\\nthe cow-puncher's improvement, and how soon he would be permitted the\\nfresh air. Hence Molly found him waiting in a flannel shirt of highly\\nbecoming shade, and with a silk handkerchief knotted round his throat;\\nand he told her it was good to feel respectable again.\\n\\nShe had come to read to him for the allotted time; and she threw around\\nhis shoulders the scarlet and black Navajo blanket, striped with its\\nsplendid zigzags of barbarity. Thus he half sat, half leaned, languid\\nbut at ease. In his lap lay one of the letters brought over by the\\nmessenger: and though she was midway in a book that engaged his full\\nattention--DAVID COPPERFIELD--his silence and absent look this morning\\nstopped her, and she accused him of not attending.\\n\\n“No,” he admitted; “I am thinking of something else.”\\n\\nShe looked at him with that apprehension which he knew.\\n\\n“It had to come,” said he. “And to-day I see my thoughts straighter than\\nI've been up to managing since--since my haid got clear. And now I\\nmust say these thoughts--if I can, if I can!” He stopped. His eyes were\\nintent upon her; one hand was gripping the arm of his chair.\\n\\n“You promised--” trembled Molly.\\n\\n“I promised you should love me,” he sternly interrupted. “Promised that\\nto myself. I have broken that word.”\\n\\nShe shut DAVID COPPERFIELD mechanically, and grew white.\\n\\n“Your letter has come to me hyeh,” he continued, gentle again.\\n\\n“My--” She had forgotten it.\\n\\n“The letter you wrote to tell me good-by. You wrote it a little while\\nago--not a month yet, but it's away and away long gone for me.”\\n\\n“I have never let you know--” began Molly.\\n\\n“The doctor,” he interrupted once more, but very gently now, “he gave\\nawdehs I must be kept quiet. I reckon yu' thought tellin' me might--”\\n\\n“Forgive me!” cried the girl. “Indeed I ought to have told you sooner!\\nIndeed I had no excuse!”\\n\\n“Why, should yu' tell me if yu' preferred not? You had written. And you\\nspeak” (he lifted the letter) “of never being able to repay kindness;\\nbut you have turned the tables. I can never repay you by anything! by\\nanything! So I had figured I would just jog back to Sunk Creek and let\\nyou get away, if you did not want to say that kind of good-by. For I saw\\nthe boxes. Mrs. Taylor is too nice a woman to know the trick of lyin',\\nand she could not deceive me. I have knowed yu' were going away for good\\never since I saw those boxes. But now hyeh comes your letter, and it\\nseems no way but I must speak. I have thought a deal, lyin' in this\\nroom. And--to-day--I can say what I have thought. I could not make you\\nhappy.” He stopped, but she did not answer. His voice had grown softer\\nthan whispering, but yet was not a whisper. From its quiet syllables she\\nturned away, blinded with sudden tears.\\n\\n“Once, I thought love must surely be enough,” he continued. “And\\nI thought if I could make you love me, you could learn me to be\\nless--less--more your kind. And I think I could give you a pretty good\\nsort of love. But that don't help the little mean pesky things of day by\\nday that make roughness or smoothness for folks tied together so awful\\nclose. Mrs. Taylor hyeh--she don't know anything better than Taylor\\ndoes. She don't want anything he can't give her. Her friends will do for\\nhim and his for her. And when I dreamed of you in my home--” he closed\\nhis eyes and drew a long breath. At last he looked at her again. “This\\nis no country for a lady. Will yu' forget and forgive the bothering I\\nhave done?”\\n\\n“Oh!” cried Molly. “Oh!” And she put her hands to her eyes. She had\\nrisen and stood with her face covered.\\n\\n“I surely had to tell you this all out, didn't I?” said the cow-puncher,\\nfaintly, in his chair.\\n\\n“Oh!” said Molly again.\\n\\n“I have put it clear how it is,” he pursued. “I ought to have seen from\\nthe start I was not the sort to keep you happy.”\\n\\n“But,” said Molly--“but I--you ought--please try to keep me happy!” And\\nsinking by his chair, she hid her face on his knees.\\n\\nSpeechless, he bent down and folded her round, putting his hands on the\\nhair that had been always his delight. Presently he whispered:-- “You\\nhave beat me; how can I fight this?”\\n\\nShe answered nothing. The Navajo's scarlet and black folds fell over\\nboth. Not with words, not even with meeting eyes, did the two plight\\ntheir troth in this first new hour. So they remained long, the fair head\\nnesting in the great arms, and the black head laid against it, while\\nover the silent room presided the little Grandmother Stark in her frame,\\nrosy, blue, and flaxen, not quite familiar, not quite smiling.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXVIII. NO DREAM TO WAKE FROM\\n\\n\\nFor a long while after she had left him, he lay still, stretched in\\nhis chair. His eyes were fixed steadily upon the open window and the\\nsunshine outside. There he watched the movement of the leaves upon the\\ngreen cottonwoods. What had she said to him when she went? She had said,\\n“Now I know how unhappy I have been.” These sweet words he repeated to\\nhimself over and over, fearing in some way that he might lose them. They\\nalmost slipped from him at times; but with a jump of his mind he caught\\nthem again and held them,--and then--“I'm not all strong yet,” he\\nmurmured. “I must have been very sick.” And, weak from his bullet\\nwound and fever, he closed his eyes without knowing it. There were the\\ncottonwoods again, waving, waving; and he felt the cool, pleasant air\\nfrom the window. He saw the light draught stir the ashes in the great\\nstone fireplace. “I have been asleep,” he said. “But she was cert'nly\\nhere herself. Oh, yes. Surely. She always has to go away every day\\nbecause the doctor says--why, she was readin'!” he broke off, aloud.\\n“DAVID COPPERFIELD.” There it was on the floor. “Aha! nailed you\\nanyway!” he said. “But how scared I am of myself!--You're a fool. Of\\ncourse it's so. No fever business could make yu' feel like this.”\\n\\nHis eye dwelt awhile on the fireplace, next on the deer horns, and\\nnext it travelled toward the shelf where her books were; but it stopped\\nbefore reaching them.\\n\\n“Better say off the names before I look,” said he. “I've had a heap o'\\nmisreading visions. And--and supposin'--if this was just my sickness\\nfooling me some more--I'd want to die. I would die! Now we'll see. If\\nCOPPERFIELD is on the floor” (he looked stealthily to be sure that it\\nwas), “then she was readin' to me when everything happened, and then\\nthere should be a hole in the book row, top, left. Top, left,” he\\nrepeated, and warily brought his glance to the place. “Proved!” he\\ncried. “It's all so!”\\n\\nHe now noticed the miniature of Grandmother Stark. “You are awful like\\nher,” he whispered. “You're cert'nly awful like her. May I kiss you too,\\nma'am?”\\n\\nThen, tottering, he rose from his sick-chair. The Navajo blanket fell\\nfrom his shoulders, and gradually, experimentally, he stood upright.\\n\\nHelping himself with his hand slowly along the wall of the room, and\\nround to the opposite wall with many a pause, he reached the picture,\\nand very gently touched the forehead of the ancestral dame with his\\nlips. “I promise to make your little girl happy,” he whispered.\\n\\nHe almost fell in stooping to the portrait, but caught himself and stood\\ncarefully quiet, trembling, and speaking to himself. “Where is your\\nstrength?” he demanded. “I reckon it is joy that has unsteadied your\\nlaigs.”\\n\\nThe door opened. It was she, come back with his dinner.\\n\\n“My Heavens!” she said; and setting the tray down, she rushed to him.\\nShe helped him back to his chair, and covered him again. He had suffered\\nno hurt, but she clung to him; and presently he moved and let himself\\nkiss her with fuller passion.\\n\\n“I will be good,” he whispered.\\n\\n“You must,” she said. “You looked so pale!”\\n\\n“You are speakin' low like me,” he answered. “But we have no dream we\\ncan wake from.”\\n\\nHad she surrendered on this day to her cow-puncher, her wild man? Was she\\nforever wholly his? Had the Virginian's fire so melted her heart that no\\nrift in it remained? So she would have thought if any thought had come\\nto her. But in his arms to-day, thought was lost in something more\\ndivine.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXIX. WORD TO BENNINGTON\\n\\n\\nThey kept their secret for a while, or at least they had that special\\njoy of believing that no one in all the world but themselves knew this\\nthat had happened to them. But I think that there was one person who\\nknew how to keep a secret even better than these two lovers. Mrs. Taylor\\nmade no remarks to any one whatever. Nobody on Bear Creek, however, was\\nso extraordinarily cheerful and serene. That peculiar severity which she\\nhad manifested in the days when Molly was packing her possessions,\\nhad now altogether changed. In these days she was endlessly kind and\\nindulgent to her “deary.” Although, as a housekeeper, Mrs. Taylor\\nbelieved in punctuality at meals, and visited her offspring with\\ndiscipline when they were late without good and sufficient excuse, Molly\\nwas now exempt from the faintest hint of reprimand.\\n\\n“And it's not because you're not her mother,” said George Taylor,\\nbitterly. “She used to get it, too. And we're the only ones that get it.\\nThere she comes, just as we're about ready to quit! Aren't you going to\\nsay NOTHING to her?”\\n\\n“George,” said his mother, “when you've saved a man's life it'll be time\\nfor you to talk.”\\n\\nSo Molly would come in to her meals with much irregularity; and her\\nremarks about the imperfections of her clock met with no rejoinder. And\\nyet one can scarcely be so severe as had been Mrs. Taylor, and become\\nwholly as mild as milk. There was one recurrent event that could\\ninvariably awaken hostile symptoms in the dame. Whenever she saw a\\nletter arrive with the Bennington postmark upon it, she shook her fist\\nat that letter. “What's family pride?” she would say to herself. “Taylor\\ncould be a Son of the Revolution if he'd a mind to. I wonder if she has\\ntold her folks yet.”\\n\\nAnd when letters directed to Bennington would go out, Mrs. Taylor would\\ninspect every one as if its envelope ought to grow transparent beneath\\nher eyes, and yield up to her its great secret, if it had one. But in\\ntruth these letters had no great secret to yield up, until one day--yes;\\none day Mrs. Taylor would have burst, were bursting a thing that people\\noften did. Three letters were the cause of this emotion on Mrs. Taylor's\\npart; one addressed to Bennington, one to Dunbarton, and the third--here\\nwas the great excitement--to Bennington, but not in the little\\nschoolmarm's delicate writing. A man's hand had traced those plain,\\nsteady vowels and consonants.\\n\\n“It's come!” exclaimed Mrs. Taylor, at this sight. “He has written to\\nher mother himself.”\\n\\nThat is what the Virginian had done, and here is how it had come about.\\n\\nThe sick man's convalescence was achieved. The weeks had brought back to\\nhim, not his whole strength yet--that could come only by many miles\\nof open air on the back of Monte; but he was strong enough now to GET\\nstrength. When a patient reaches this stage, he is out of the woods.\\n\\nHe had gone for a little walk with his nurse. They had taken (under the\\ndoctor's recommendation) several such little walks, beginning with a\\nfive-minute one, and at last to-day accomplishing three miles.\\n\\n“No, it has not been too far,” said he. “I am afraid I could walk twice\\nas far.”\\n\\n“Afraid?”\\n\\n“Yes. Because it means I can go to work again. This thing we have had\\ntogether is over.”\\n\\nFor reply, she leaned against him.\\n\\n“Look at you!” he said. “Only a little while ago you had to help me\\nstand on my laigs. And now--” For a while there was silence between\\nthem. “I have never had a right down sickness before,” he presently went\\non. “Not to remember, that is. If any person had told me I could ENJOY\\nsuch a thing--” He said no more, for she reached up, and no more speech\\nwas possible.\\n\\n“How long has it been?” he next asked her.\\n\\nShe told him.\\n\\n“Well, if it could be forever--no. Not forever with no more than this.\\nI reckon I'd be sick again! But if it could be forever with just you and\\nme, and no one else to bother with. But any longer would not be doing\\nright by your mother. She would have a right to think ill of me.”\\n\\n“Oh!” said the girl. “Let us keep it.”\\n\\n“Not after I am gone. Your mother must be told.”\\n\\n“It seems so--can't we--oh, why need anybody know?”\\n\\n“Your mother ain't 'anybody.' She is your mother. I feel mighty\\nresponsible to her for what I have done.”\\n\\n“But I did it!”\\n\\n“Do you think so? Your mother will not think so. I am going to write to\\nher to-day.”\\n\\n“You! Write to my mother! Oh, then everything will be so different! They\\nwill all--” Molly stopped before the rising visions of Bennington. Upon\\nthe fairy-tale that she had been living with her cow-boy lover broke the\\nvoices of the world. She could hear them from afar. She could see the\\neyes of Bennington watching this man at her side. She could imagine the\\nears of Bennington listening for slips in his English. There loomed upon\\nher the round of visits which they would have to make. The ringing of\\nthe door-bells, the waiting in drawing-rooms for the mistress to descend\\nand utter her prepared congratulations, while her secret eye devoured\\nthe Virginian's appearance, and his manner of standing and sitting. He\\nwould be wearing gloves, instead of fringed gauntlets of buckskin. In a\\nsmooth black coat and waistcoat, how could they perceive the man he was?\\nDuring those short formal interviews, what would they ever find out of\\nthe things that she knew about him? The things for which she was proud\\nof him? He would speak shortly and simply; they would say, “Oh, yes!”\\n and “How different you must find this from Wyoming!”--and then, after\\nthe door was shut behind his departing back they would say--He would\\nbe totally underrated, not in the least understood. Why should he be\\nsubjected to this? He should never be!\\n\\nNow in all these half-formed, hurried, distressing thoughts which\\nstreamed through the girl's mind, she altogether forgot one truth. True\\nit was that the voice of the world would speak as she imagined. True it\\nwas that in the eyes of her family and acquaintance this lover of her\\nchoice would be examined even more like a SPECIMEN than are other lovers\\nupon these occasions: and all accepted lovers have to face this ordeal\\nof being treated like specimens by the other family. But dear me!\\nmost of us manage to stand it, don't we? It isn't, perhaps, the\\nmost delicious experience that we can recall in connection with our\\nengagement. But it didn't prove fatal. We got through it somehow. We\\ndined with Aunt Jane, and wined with Uncle Joseph, and perhaps had two\\nfingers given to us by old Cousin Horatio, whose enormous fortune was of\\nthe greatest importance to everybody. And perhaps fragments of the other\\nfamily's estimate of us subsequently reached our own ears. But if a\\nchosen lover cannot stand being treated as a specimen by the other\\nfamily, he's a very weak vessel, and not worth any good girl's love.\\nThat's all I can say for him.\\n\\nNow the Virginian was scarcely what even his enemy would term a weak\\nvessel; and Molly's jealousy of the impression which he might make upon\\nBennington was vastly superfluous. She should have known that he would\\nindeed care to make a good impression; but that such anxiety on his part\\nwould be wholly for her sake, that in the eyes of her friends she might\\nstand justified in taking him for her wedded husband. So far as he was\\nconcerned apart from her, Aunt Jane and Uncle Joseph might say anything\\nthey pleased, or think anything they pleased. His character was open for\\ninvestigation. Judge Henry would vouch for him.\\n\\nThis is what he would have said to his sweetheart had she but revealed\\nto him her perturbations. But she did not reveal them; and they were not\\nof the order that he with his nature was likely to divine. I do not\\nknow what good would have come from her speaking out to him, unless that\\nperfect understanding between lovers which indeed is a good thing. But\\nI do not believe that he could have reassured her; and I am certain that\\nshe could not have prevented his writing to her mother.\\n\\n“Well, then,” she sighed at last, “if you think so, I will tell her.”\\n\\nThat sigh of hers, be it well understood, was not only because of those\\nfar-off voices which the world would in consequence of her news be\\nlifting presently. It came also from bidding farewell to the fairy-tale\\nwhich she must leave now; that land in which she and he had been living\\nclose together alone, unhindered, unmindful of all things.\\n\\n“Yes, you will tell her,” said her lover. “And I must tell her too.”\\n\\n“Both of us?” questioned the girl.\\n\\nWhat would he say to her mother? How would her mother like such a letter\\nas he would write to her? Suppose he should misspell a word? Would not\\nsentences from him at this time--written sentences--be a further bar to\\nhis welcome acceptance at Bennington?\\n\\n“Why don't you send messages by me?” she asked him.\\n\\nHe shook his head. “She is not going to like it, anyway,” he answered.\\n“I must speak to her direct. It would be like shirking.”\\n\\nMolly saw how true his instinct was here; and a little flame shot upward\\nfrom the glow of her love and pride in him. Oh, if they could all only\\nknow that he was like this when you understood him! She did not dare say\\nout to him what her fear was about this letter of his to her mother. She\\ndid not dare because--well, because she lacked a little faith. That is\\nit, I am afraid. And for that sin she was her own punishment. For in\\nthis day, and in many days to come, the pure joy of her love was vexed\\nand clouded, all through a little lack of faith; while for him, perfect\\nin his faith, his joy was like crystal.\\n\\n“Tell me what you're going to write,” she said.\\n\\nHe smiled at her. “No.”\\n\\n“Aren't you going to let me see it when it's done?”\\n\\n“No.” Then a freakish look came into his eyes. “I'll let yu' see\\nanything I write to other women.” And he gave her one of his long\\nkisses. “Let's get through with it together,” he suggested, when they\\nwere once more in his sick-room, that room which she had given to him.\\n“You'll sit one side o' the table, and I'll sit the other, and we'll go\\nahaid; and pretty soon it will be done.”\\n\\n“O dear!” she said. “Yes, I suppose that is the best way.”\\n\\nAnd so, accordingly, they took their places. The inkstand stood between\\nthem. Beside each of them she distributed paper enough, almost, for a\\npresidential message. And pens and pencils were in plenty. Was this not\\nthe headquarters of the Bear Creek schoolmarm?\\n\\n“Why, aren't you going to do it in pencil first?” she exclaimed, looking\\nup from her vacant sheet. His pen was moving slowly, but steadily.\\n\\n“No, I don't reckon I need to,” he answered, with his nose close to the\\npaper. “Oh, damnation, there's a blot!” He tore his spoiled beginning in\\nsmall bits, and threw them into the fireplace. “You've got it too full,”\\n he commented; and taking the inkstand, he tipped a little from it out\\nof the window. She sat lost among her false starts. Had she heard him\\nswear, she would not have minded. She rather liked it when he swore. He\\npossessed that quality in his profanity of not offending by it. It is\\nquite wonderful how much worse the same word will sound in one man's\\nlips than in another's. But she did not hear him. Her mind was among a\\nlitter of broken sentences. Each thought which she began ran out into\\nthe empty air, or came against some stone wall. So there she sat, her\\neyes now upon that inexorable blank sheet that lay before her, waiting,\\nand now turned with vacant hopelessness upon the sundry objects in the\\nroom. And while she thus sat accomplishing nothing, opposite to her the\\nblack head bent down, and the steady pen moved from phrase to phrase.\\n\\nShe became aware of his gazing at her, flushed and solemn. That strange\\ncolor of the sea-water, which she could never name, was lustrous in his\\neyes. He was folding his letter.\\n\\n“You have finished?” she said.\\n\\n“Yes.” His voice was very quiet. “I feel like an honester man.”\\n\\n“Perhaps I can do something to-night at Mrs. Taylor's,” she said,\\nlooking at her paper.\\n\\nOn it were a few words crossed out. This was all she had to show. At\\nthis set task in letter-writing, the cow-puncher had greatly excelled\\nthe schoolmarm!\\n\\nBut that night, while he lay quite fast asleep in his bed, she was\\nkeeping vigil in her room at Mrs. Taylor's.\\n\\nAccordingly, the next day, those three letters departed for the mail,\\nand Mrs. Taylor consequently made her exclamation, “It's come!”\\n\\nOn the day before the Virginian returned to take up his work at Judge\\nHenry's ranch, he and Molly announced their news. What Molly said to\\nMrs. Taylor and what Mrs. Taylor said to her, is of no interest to us,\\nthough it was of much to them.\\n\\nBut Mr. McLean happened to make a call quite early in the morning to\\ninquire for his friend's health.\\n\\n“Lin,” began the Virginian, “there is no harm in your knowing an hour or\\nso before the rest, I am--”\\n\\n“Lord!” said Mr. McLean, indulgently. “Everybody has knowed that since\\nthe day she found yu' at the spring.”\\n\\n“It was not so, then,” said the Virginian, crossly.\\n\\n“Lord! Everybody has knowed it right along.”\\n\\n“Hmp!” said the Virginian. “I didn't know this country was that rank\\nwith gossips.”\\n\\nMr. McLean laughed mirthfully at the lover. “Well,” he said, “Mrs.\\nMcLean will be glad. She told me to give yu' her congratulations quite\\na while ago. I was to have 'em ready just as soon as ever yu' asked for\\n'em yourself.” Lin had been made a happy man some twelve months previous\\nto this. And now, by way of an exchange of news, he added: “We're\\nexpectin' a little McLean down on Box Elder. That's what you'll be\\nexpectin' some of these days, I hope.”\\n\\n“Yes,” murmured the Virginian, “I hope so too.”\\n\\n“And I don't guess,” said Lin, “that you and I will do much shufflin' of\\nother folks' children any more.”\\n\\nWhereupon he and the Virginian shook hands silently, and understood each\\nother very well.\\n\\nOn the day that the Virginian parted with Molly, beside the weight of\\nfarewell which lay heavy on his heart, his thoughts were also grave with\\nnews. The cattle thieves had grown more audacious. Horses and cattle\\nboth were being missed, and each man began almost to doubt his neighbor.\\n\\n“Steps will have to be taken soon by somebody, I reckon,” said the\\nlover.\\n\\n“By you?” she asked quickly.\\n\\n“Most likely I'll get mixed up with it.”\\n\\n“What will you have to do?”\\n\\n“Can't say. I'll tell yu' when I come back.”\\n\\nSo did he part from her, leaving her more kisses than words to remember.\\n\\nAnd what was doing at Bennington, meanwhile, and at Dunbarton? Those\\nthree letters which by their mere outside had so moved Mrs. Taylor,\\nproduced by their contents much painful disturbance.\\n\\nIt will be remembered that Molly wrote to her mother, and to her\\ngreat-aunt. That announcement to her mother was undertaken first. Its\\ncomposition occupied three hours and a half, and it filled eleven pages,\\nnot counting a postscript upon the twelfth. The letter to the great-aunt\\ntook only ten minutes. I cannot pretend to explain why this one was\\nso greatly superior to the other; but such is the remarkable fact. Its\\nbeginning, to be sure, did give the old lady a start; she had dismissed\\nthe cow-boy from her probabilities.\\n\\n“Tut, tut, tut!” she exclaimed out loud in her bedroom. “She has thrown\\nherself away on that fellow!”\\n\\nBut some sentences at the end made her pause and sit still for a long\\nwhile. The severity upon her face changed to tenderness, gradually. “Ah,\\nme,” she sighed. “If marriage were as simple as love!” Then she went\\nslowly downstairs, and out into her garden, where she walked long\\nbetween the box borders. “But if she has found a great love,” said the\\nold lady at length. And she returned to her bedroom, and opened an old\\ndesk, and read some old letters.\\n\\nThere came to her the next morning a communication from Bennington. This\\nhad been penned frantically by poor Mrs. Wood. As soon as she had been\\nable to gather her senses after the shock of her daughter's eleven pages\\nand the postscript, the mother had poured out eight pages herself to the\\neldest member of the family. There had been, indeed, much excuse for the\\npoor lady. To begin with, Molly had constructed her whole opening\\npage with the express and merciful intention of preparing her mother.\\nConsequently, it made no sense whatever. Its effect was the usual effect\\nof remarks designed to break a thing gently. It merely made Mrs. Wood's\\nhead swim, and filled her with a sickening dread. “Oh, mercy, Sarah,”\\n she had cried, “come here. What does this mean?” And then, fortified by\\nher elder daughter, she had turned over that first page and found what\\nit meant on the top of the second. “A savage with knives and pistols!”\\n she wailed.\\n\\n“Well, mother, I always told you so,” said her daughter Sarah.\\n\\n“What is a foreman?” exclaimed the mother. “And who is Judge Henry?”\\n\\n“She has taken a sort of upper servant,” said Sarah. “If it is allowed\\nto go as far as a wedding, I doubt if I can bring myself to be present.”\\n (This threat she proceeded to make to Molly, with results that shall be\\nset forth in their proper place.)\\n\\n“The man appears to have written to me himself,” said Mrs. Wood.\\n\\n“He knows no better,” said Sarah.\\n\\n“Bosh!” said Sarah's husband later. “It was a very manly thing to do.”\\n Thus did consternation rage in the house at Bennington. Molly might\\nhave spared herself the many assurances that she gave concerning\\nthe universal esteem in which her cow-puncher was held, and the fair\\nprospects which were his. So, in the first throes of her despair, Mrs.\\nWood wrote those eight not maturely considered pages to the great-aunt.\\n\\n“Tut, tut, tut!” said the great-aunt as she read them. Her face was much\\nmore severe to-day. “You'd suppose,” she said, “that the girl had been\\nkidnapped! Why, she has kept him waiting three years!” And then she\\nread more, but soon put the letter down with laughter. For Mrs. Wood\\nhad repeated in writing that early outburst of hers about a savage with\\nknives and pistols. “Law!” said the great-aunt. “Law, what a fool Lizzie\\nis!”\\n\\nSo she sat down and wrote to Mrs. Wood a wholesome reply about putting\\na little more trust in her own flesh and blood, and reminding her among\\nother things that General Stark had himself been wont to carry knives\\nand pistols owing to the necessities of his career, but that he had\\noccasionally taken them off, as did probably this young man in Wyoming.\\n“You had better send me the letter he has written you,” she concluded.\\n“I shall know much better what to think after I have seen that.”\\n\\nIt is not probable that Mrs. Wood got much comfort from this\\ncommunication; and her daughter Sarah was actually enraged by it.\\n“She grows more perverse as she nears her dotage,” said Sarah. But the\\nVirginian's letter was sent to Dunbarton, where the old lady sat herself\\ndown to read it with much attention.\\n\\nHere is what the Virginian had said to the unknown mother of his\\nsweetheart.\\n\\nMRS. JOHN STARK WOOD Bennington, Vermont.\\n\\nMadam: If your daughter Miss Wood has ever told you about her saving\\na man's life here when some Indians had shot him that is the man who\\nwrites to you now. I don't think she can have told you right about\\nthat affair for she is the only one in this country who thinks it was\\na little thing. So I must tell you it, the main points. Such an action\\nwould have been thought highly of in a Western girl, but with Miss\\nWood's raising nobody had a right to expect it.\\n\\n“Indeed!” snorted the great-aunt. “Well, he would be right, if I had not\\nhad a good deal more to do with her 'raising' than ever Lizzie had.” And\\nshe went on with the letter.\\n\\nI was starting in to die when she found me. I did not know anything\\nthen, and she pulled me back from where I was half in the next world.\\nShe did not know but what Indians would get her too but I could not make\\nher leave me. I am a heavy man one hundred and seventy-three stripped\\nwhen in full health. She lifted me herself from the ground me helping\\nscarce any for there was not much help in me that day. She washed my\\nwound and brought me to with her own whiskey. Before she could get me\\nhome I was out of my head but she kept me on my horse somehow and talked\\nwisely to me so I minded her and did not go clean crazy till she had got\\nme safe to bed. The doctor says I would have died all the same if she\\nhad not nursed me the way she did. It made me love her more which I did\\nnot know I could. But there is no end, for this writing it down makes me\\nlove her more as I write it.\\n\\nAnd now Mrs. Wood I am sorry this will be bad news for you to hear. I\\nknow you would never choose such a man as I am for her for I have got\\nno education and must write humble against my birth. I wish I could make\\nthe news easier but truth is the best.\\n\\nI am of old stock in Virginia. English and one Scotch Irish grandmother\\nmy father's father brought from Kentucky. We have always stayed at the\\nsame place farmers and hunters not bettering our lot and very plain. We\\nhave fought when we got the chance, under Old Hickory and in Mexico and\\nmy father and two brothers were killed in the Valley sixty-four. Always\\nwith us one son has been apt to run away and I was the one this time. I\\nhad too much older brothering to suit me. But now I am doing well being\\nin full sight of prosperity and not too old and very strong my health\\nhaving stood the sundries it has been put through. She shall teach\\nschool no more when she is mine. I wish I could make this news easier\\nfor you Mrs. Wood. I do not like promises I have heard so many. I will\\ntell any man of your family anything he likes to ask one, and Judge\\nHenry would tell you about my reputation. I have seen plenty rough\\nthings but can say I have never killed for pleasure or profit and am not\\none of that kind, always preferring peace. I have had to live in places\\nwhere they had courts and lawyers so called but an honest man was all\\nthe law you could find in five hundred miles. I have not told her about\\nthose things not because I am ashamed of them but there are so many\\nthings too dark for a girl like her to hear about.\\n\\nI had better tell you the way I know I love Miss Wood. I am not a boy\\nnow, and women are no new thing to me. A man like me who has travelled\\nmeets many of them as he goes and passes on but I stopped when I came\\nto Miss Wood. That is three years but I have not gone on. What right has\\nsuch as he? you will say. So did I say it after she had saved my life.\\nIt was hard to get to that point and keep there with her around me all\\nday. But I said to myself you have bothered her for three years with\\nyour love and if you let your love bother her you don't love her like\\nyou should and you must quit for her sake who has saved your life. I did\\nnot know what I was going to do with my life after that but I supposed\\nI could go somewhere and work hard and so Mrs. Wood I told her I would\\ngive her up. But she said no. It is going to be hard for her to get used\\nto a man like me--\\n\\nBut at this point in the Virginian's letter, the old great-aunt could\\nread no more. She rose, and went over to that desk where lay those faded\\nletters of her own. She laid her head down upon the package, and as her\\ntears flowed quietly upon it, “O dear,” she whispered, “O dear! And this\\nis what I lost!”\\n\\nTo her girl upon Bear Creek she wrote the next day. And this word from\\nDunbarton was like balm among the harsh stings Molly was receiving. The\\nvoices of the world reached her in gathering numbers, and not one of\\nthem save that great-aunt's was sweet. Her days were full of hurts; and\\nthere was no one by to kiss the hurts away. Nor did she even hear from\\nher lover any more now. She only knew he had gone into lonely regions\\nupon his errand.\\n\\nThat errand took him far:-- Across the Basin, among the secret places\\nof Owl Creek, past the Washakie Needles, over the Divide to Gros Ventre,\\nand so through a final barrier of peaks into the borders of East Idaho.\\nThere, by reason of his bidding me, I met him, and came to share in a\\npart of his errand.\\n\\nIt was with no guide that I travelled to him. He had named a little\\nstation on the railroad, and from thence he had charted my route by\\nmeans of landmarks. Did I believe in omens, the black storm that I set\\nout in upon my horse would seem like one to-day. But I had been living\\nin cities and smoke; and Idaho, even with rain, was delightful to me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXX. A STABLE ON THE FLAT\\n\\n\\nWhen the first landmark, the lone clump of cottonwoods, came at length\\nin sight, dark and blurred in the gentle rain, standing out perhaps\\na mile beyond the distant buildings, my whole weary body hailed the\\napproach of repose. Saving the noon hour, I had been in the saddle since\\nsix, and now six was come round again. The ranch, my resting-place for\\nthis night, was a ruin--cabin, stable, and corral. Yet after the twelve\\nhours of pushing on and on through silence, still to have silence, still\\nto eat and go to sleep in it, perfectly fitted the mood of both my flesh\\nand spirit. At noon, when for a while I had thrown off my long oilskin\\ncoat, merely the sight of the newspaper half crowded into my pocket had\\nbeen a displeasing reminder of the railway, and cities, and affairs. But\\nfor its possible help to build fires, it would have come no farther with\\nme. The great levels around me lay cooled and freed of dust by the\\nwet weather, and full of sweet airs. Far in front the foot-hills rose\\nthrough the rain, indefinite and mystic. I wanted no speech with any\\none, nor to be near human beings at all. I was steeped in a revery as of\\nthe primal earth; even thoughts themselves had almost ceased motion. To\\nlie down with wild animals, with elk and deer, would have made my waking\\ndream complete; and since such dream could not be, the cattle around the\\ndeserted buildings, mere dots as yet across separating space, were my\\nproper companions for this evening.\\n\\nTo-morrow night I should probably be camping with the Virginian in the\\nfoot-hills. At his letter's bidding I had come eastward across Idaho,\\nabandoning my hunting in the Saw Tooth Range to make this journey with\\nhim back through the Tetons. It was a trail known to him, and not to\\nmany other honest men. Horse Thief Pass was the name his letter gave it.\\nBusiness (he was always brief) would call him over there at this time.\\nReturning, he must attend to certain matters in the Wind River country.\\nThere I could leave by stage for the railroad, or go on with him the\\nwhole way back to Sunk Creek. He designated for our meeting the forks\\nof a certain little stream in the foot-hills which to-day's ride had\\nbrought in sight. There would be no chance for him to receive an answer\\nfrom me in the intervening time. If by a certain day--which was four\\ndays off still--I had not reached the forks, he would understand I had\\nother plans. To me it was like living back in ages gone, this way of\\nmeeting my friend, this choice of a stream so far and lonely that its\\nvery course upon the maps was wrongly traced. And to leave behind all\\nnoise and mechanisms, and set out at ease, slowly, with one packhorse,\\ninto the wilderness, made me feel that the ancient earth was indeed my\\nmother and that I had found her again after being lost among houses,\\ncustoms, and restraints. I should arrive three days early at the\\nforks--three days of margin seeming to me a wise precaution against\\ndelays unforeseen. If the Virginian were not there, good; I could fish\\nand be happy. If he were there but not ready to start, good; I could\\nstill fish and be happy. And remembering my Eastern helplessness in\\nthe year when we had met first, I enjoyed thinking how I had come to be\\ntrusted. In those days I had not been allowed to go from the ranch for\\nso much as an afternoon's ride unless tied to him by a string, so to\\nspeak; now I was crossing unmapped spaces with no guidance. The man who\\ncould do this was scarce any longer a “tenderfoot.”\\n\\nMy vision, as I rode, took in serenely the dim foot-hills,--to-morrow's\\ngoal,--and nearer in the vast wet plain the clump of cottonwoods, and\\nstill nearer my lodging for to-night with the dotted cattle round it.\\nAnd now my horse neighed. I felt his gait freshen for the journey's\\nend, and leaning to pat his neck I noticed his ears no longer slack and\\ninattentive, but pointing forward to where food and rest awaited both of\\nus. Twice he neighed, impatiently and long; and as he quickened his gait\\nstill more, the packhorse did the same, and I realized that there was\\nabout me still a spice of the tenderfoot: those dots were not cattle;\\nthey were horses.\\n\\nMy horse had put me in the wrong. He had known his kind from afar,\\nand was hastening to them. The plainsman's eye was not yet mine; and I\\nsmiled a little as I rode. When was I going to know, as by instinct, the\\ndifferent look of horses and cattle across some two or three miles of\\nplain?\\n\\nThese miles we finished soon. The buildings changed in their aspect as\\nthey grew to my approach, showing their desolation more clearly, and in\\nsome way bringing apprehension into my mood. And around them the horses,\\ntoo, all standing with ears erect, watching me as I came--there was\\nsomething about them; or was it the silence? For the silence which I had\\nliked until now seemed suddenly to be made too great by the presence of\\nthe deserted buildings. And then the door of the stable opened, and\\nmen came out and stood, also watching me arrive. By the time I was\\ndismounting more were there. It was senseless to feel as unpleasant as\\nI did, and I strove to give to them a greeting that should sound easy.\\nI told them that I hoped there was room for one more here to-night. Some\\nof them had answered my greeting, but none of them answered this; and\\nas I began to be sure that I recognized several of their strangely\\nimperturbable faces, the Virginian came from the stable; and at that\\nwelcome sight my relief spoke out instantly.\\n\\n“I am here, you see!”\\n\\n“Yes, I do see.” I looked hard at him, for in his voice was the same\\nstrangeness that I felt in everything around me. But he was looking at\\nhis companions. “This gentleman is all right,” he told them.\\n\\n“That may be,” said one whom I now knew that I had seen before at Sunk\\nCreek; “but he was not due to-night.”\\n\\n“Nor to-morrow,” said another.\\n\\n“Nor yet the day after,” a third added.\\n\\nThe Virginian fell into his drawl. “None of you was ever early for\\nanything, I presume.”\\n\\nOne retorted, laughing, “Oh, we're not suspicioning you of complicity.”\\n\\nAnd another, “Not even when we remember how thick you and Steve used to\\nbe.”\\n\\nWhatever jokes they meant by this he did not receive as jokes. I saw\\nsomething like a wince pass over his face, and a flush follow it. But he\\nnow spoke to me. “We expected to be through before this,” he began. “I'm\\nright sorry you have come to-night. I know you'd have preferred to keep\\naway.”\\n\\n“We want him to explain himself,” put in one of the others. “If he\\nsatisfies us, he's free to go away.”\\n\\n“Free to go away!” I now exclaimed. But at the indulgence in their\\nfrontier smile I cooled down. “Gentlemen,” I said, “I don't know why my\\nmovements interest you so much. It's quite a compliment! May I get under\\nshelter while I explain?”\\n\\nNo request could have been more natural, for the rain had now begun to\\nfall in straight floods. Yet there was a pause before one of them said,\\n“He might as well.”\\n\\nThe Virginian chose to say nothing more; but he walked beside me into\\nthe stable. Two men sat there together, and a third guarded them. At\\nthat sight I knew suddenly what I had stumbled upon; and on the impulse\\nI murmured to the Virginian, “You're hanging them to-morrow.”\\n\\nHe kept his silence.\\n\\n“You may have three guesses,” said a man behind me.\\n\\nBut I did not need them. And in the recoil of my insight the clump\\nof cottonwoods came into my mind, black and grim. No other trees high\\nenough grew within ten miles. This, then, was the business that the\\nVirginian's letter had so curtly mentioned. My eyes went into all\\ncorners of the stable, but no other prisoners were here. I half expected\\nto see Trampas, and I half feared to see Shorty; for poor stupid\\nShorty's honesty had not been proof against frontier temptations, and he\\nhad fallen away from the company of his old friends. Often of late I\\nhad heard talk at Sunk Creek of breaking up a certain gang of horse and\\ncattle thieves that stole in one Territory and sold in the next, and\\nknew where to hide in the mountains between. And now it had come to the\\npoint; forces had been gathered, a long expedition made, and here they\\nwere, successful under the Virginian's lead, but a little later than\\ntheir calculations. And here was I, a little too early, and a witness in\\nconsequence. My presence seemed a simple thing to account for; but when\\nI had thus accounted for it, one of them said with good nature:-- “So\\nyou find us here, and we find you here. Which is the most surprised, I\\nwonder?”\\n\\n“There's no telling,” said I, keeping as amiable as I could; “nor any\\ntelling which objects the most.”\\n\\n“Oh, there's no objection here. You're welcome to stay. But not welcome\\nto go, I expect. He ain't welcome to go, is he?”\\n\\nBy the answers that their faces gave him it was plain that I was not.\\n“Not till we are through,” said one.\\n\\n“He needn't to see anything,”' another added.\\n\\n“Better sleep late to-morrow morning,” a third suggested to me.\\n\\nI did not wish to stay here. I could have made some sort of camp apart\\nfrom them before dark; but in the face of their needless caution I was\\nhelpless. I made no attempt to inquire what kind of spy they imagined I\\ncould be, what sort of rescue I could bring in this lonely country; my\\ntoo early appearance seemed to be all that they looked at. And again\\nmy eyes sought the prisoners. Certainly there were only two. One was\\nchewing tobacco, and talking now and then to his guard as if nothing\\nwere the matter. The other sat dull in silence, not moving his eyes;\\nbut his face worked, and I noticed how he continually moistened his dry\\nlips. As I looked at these doomed prisoners, whose fate I was invited to\\nsleep through to-morrow morning, the one who was chewing quietly nodded\\nto me.\\n\\n“You don't remember me?” he said.\\n\\nIt was Steve! Steve of Medicine Bow! The pleasant Steve of my first\\nevening in the West. Some change of beard had delayed my instant\\nrecognition of his face. Here he sat sentenced to die. A shock, chill\\nand painful, deprived me of speech.\\n\\nHe had no such weak feelings. “Have yu' been to Medicine Bow lately?” he\\ninquired. “That's getting to be quite a while ago.”\\n\\nI assented. I should have liked to say something natural and kind,\\nbut words stuck against my will, and I stood awkward and ill at ease,\\nnoticing idly that the silent one wore a gray flannel shirt like mine.\\nSteve looked me over, and saw in my pocket the newspaper which I had\\nbrought from the railroad and on which I had pencilled a few expenses.\\nHe asked me, Would I mind letting him have it for a while? And I gave\\nit to him eagerly, begging him to keep it as long as he wanted. I was\\novereager in my embarrassment. “You need not return it at all,” I said;\\n“those notes are nothing. Do keep it.”\\n\\nHe gave me a short glance and a smile. “Thank you,” he said; “I'll not\\nneed it beyond to-morrow morning.” And he began to search through it.\\n“Jake's election is considered sure,” he said to his companion, who\\nmade no response. “Well, Fremont County owes it to Jake.” And I left him\\ninterested in the local news.\\n\\nDead men I have seen not a few times, even some lying pale and terrible\\nafter violent ends, and the edge of this wears off; but I hope I shall\\nnever again have to be in the company with men waiting to be killed.\\nBy this time to-morrow the gray flannel shirt would be buttoned round\\na corpse. Until what moment would Steve chew? Against such fancies as\\nthese I managed presently to barricade my mind, but I made a plea to be\\nallowed to pass the night elsewhere, and I suggested the adjacent cabin.\\nBy their faces I saw that my words merely helped their distrust of me.\\nThe cabin leaked too much, they said; I would sleep drier here. One man\\ngave it to me more directly: “If you figured on camping in this stable,\\nwhat has changed your mind?” How could I tell them that I shrunk from\\nany contact with what they were doing, although I knew that only so\\ncould justice be dealt in this country? Their wholesome frontier nerves\\nknew nothing of such refinements.\\n\\nBut the Virginian understood part of it. “I am right sorry for your\\nannoyance,” he said. And now I noticed he was under a constraint very\\ndifferent from the ease of the others.\\n\\nAfter the twelve hours' ride my bones were hungry for rest. I spread my\\nblankets on some straw in a stall by myself and rolled up in them; yet\\nI lay growing broader awake, every inch of weariness stricken from my\\nexcited senses. For a while they sat over their councils, whispering\\ncautiously, so that I was made curious to hear them by not being able;\\nwas it the names of Trampas and Shorty that were once or twice spoken--I\\ncould not be sure. I heard the whisperers cease and separate. I heard\\ntheir boots as they cast them off upon the ground. And I heard the\\nbreathing of slumber begin and grow in the interior silence. To one\\nafter one sleep came, but not to me. Outside, the dull fall of the rain\\nbeat evenly, and in some angle dripped the spouting pulses of a leak.\\nSometimes a cold air blew in, bearing with it the keen wet odor of the\\nsage-brush. On hundreds of other nights this perfume had been my last\\nwaking remembrance; it had seemed to help drowsiness; and now I lay\\nstaring, thinking of this. Twice through the hours the thieves shifted\\ntheir positions with clumsy sounds, exchanging muted words with their\\nguard. So, often, had I heard other companions move and mutter in the\\ndarkness and lie down again. It was the very naturalness and usualness\\nof every fact of the night,--the stable straw, the rain outside, my\\nfamiliar blankets, the cool visits of the wind,--and with all this the\\nthought of Steve chewing and the man in the gray flannel shirt, that\\nmade the hours unearthly and strung me tight with suspense. And at last\\nI heard some one get up and begin to dress. In a little while I saw\\nlight suddenly through my closed eyelids, and then darkness shut again\\nabruptly upon them. They had swung in a lantern and found me by mistake.\\nI was the only one they did not wish to rouse. Moving and quiet talking\\nset up around me, and they began to go out of the stable. At the gleams\\nof new daylight which they let in my thoughts went to the clump of\\ncottonwoods, and I lay still with hands and feet growing steadily\\ncold. Now it was going to happen. I wondered how they would do it; one\\ninstance had been described to me by a witness, but that was done from a\\nbridge, and there had been but a single victim. This morning, would one\\nhave to wait and see the other go through with it first?\\n\\nThe smell of smoke reached me, and next the rattle of tin dishes.\\nBreakfast was something I had forgotten, and one of them was cooking it\\nnow in the dry shelter of the stable. He was alone, because the talking\\nand the steps were outside the stable, and I could hear the sounds of\\nhorses being driven into the corral and saddled. Then I perceived that\\nthe coffee was ready, and almost immediately the cook called them. One\\ncame in, shutting the door behind him as he reentered, which the rest as\\nthey followed imitated; for at each opening of the door I saw the light\\nof day leap into the stable and heard the louder sounds of the rain.\\nThen the sound and the light would again be shut out, until some one at\\nlength spoke out bluntly, bidding the door be left open on account of\\nthe smoke. What were they hiding from? he asked. The runaways that had\\nescaped? A laugh followed this sally, and the door was left open. Thus\\nI learned that there had been more thieves than the two that were\\ncaptured. It gave a little more ground for their suspicion about me and\\nmy anxiety to pass the night elsewhere. It cost nothing to detain me,\\nand they were taking no chances, however remote.\\n\\nThe fresh air and the light now filled the stable, and I lay listening\\nwhile their breakfast brought more talk from them. They were more at\\nease now than was I, who had nothing to do but carry out my role of\\nslumber in the stall; they spoke in a friendly, ordinary way, as if this\\nwere like every other morning of the week to them. They addressed the\\nprisoners with a sort of fraternal kindness, not bringing them pointedly\\ninto the conversation, nor yet pointedly leaving them out. I made out\\nthat they must all be sitting round the breakfast together, those who\\nhad to die and those who had to kill them. The Virginian I never heard\\nspeak. But I heard the voice of Steve; he discussed with his captors the\\nsundry points of his capture.\\n\\n“Do you remember a haystack?” he asked. “Away up the south fork of Gros\\nVentre?”\\n\\n“That was Thursday afternoon,” said one of the captors. “There was a\\nshower.”\\n\\n“Yes. It rained. We had you fooled that time. I was laying on the ledge\\nabove to report your movements.”\\n\\nSeveral of them laughed. “We thought you were over on Spread Creek\\nthen.”\\n\\n“I figured you thought so by the trail you left after the stack.\\nSaturday we watched you turn your back on us up Spread Creek. We were\\nsnug among the trees the other side of Snake River. That was another\\ntime we had you fooled.”\\n\\nThey laughed again at their own expense. I have heard men pick to pieces\\na hand of whist with more antagonism.\\n\\nSteve continued: “Would we head for Idaho? Would we swing back over the\\nDivide? You didn't know which! And when we generalled you on to that\\nband of horses you thought was the band you were hunting--ah, we were a\\nstrong combination!” He broke off with the first touch of bitterness I\\nhad felt in his words.\\n\\n“Nothing is any stronger than its weakest point.” It was the Virginian\\nwho said this, and it was the first word he had spoken.\\n\\n“Naturally,” said Steve. His tone in addressing the Virginian was so\\ndifferent, so curt, that I supposed he took the weakest point to\\nmean himself. But the others now showed me that I was wrong in this\\nexplanation.\\n\\n“That's so,” one said. “Its weakest point is where a rope or a gang of\\nmen is going to break when the strain comes. And you was linked with a\\npoor partner, Steve.”\\n\\n“You're right I was,” said the prisoner, back in his easy, casual voice.\\n\\n“You ought to have got yourself separated from him, Steve.”\\n\\nThere was a pause. “Yes,” said the prisoner, moodily. “I'm sitting here\\nbecause one of us blundered.” He cursed the blunderer. “Lighting his\\nfool fire queered the whole deal,” he added. As he again heavily cursed\\nthe blunderer, the others murmured to each other various I told you\\nso's.\\n\\n“You'd never have built that fire, Steve,” said one.\\n\\n“I said that when we spied the smoke,” said another. “I said, 'That's\\nnone of Steve's work, lighting fires and revealing to us their\\nwhereabouts.'”\\n\\nIt struck me that they were plying Steve with compliments.\\n\\n“Pretty hard to have the fool get away and you get caught,” a third\\nsuggested. At this they seemed to wait. I felt something curious in all\\nthis last talk.\\n\\n“Oh, did he get away?” said the prisoner, then.\\n\\nAgain they waited; and a new voice spoke huskily:-- “I built that fire,\\nboys.” It was the prisoner in the gray flannel shirt.\\n\\n“Too late, Ed,” they told him kindly. “You ain't a good liar.”\\n\\n“What makes you laugh, Steve?” said some one.\\n\\n“Oh, the things I notice.”\\n\\n“Meaning Ed was pretty slow in backing up your play? The joke is really\\non you, Steve. You'd ought never to have cursed the fire-builder if\\nyou wanted us to believe he was present. But we'd not have done much to\\nShorty, even if we had caught him. All he wants is to be scared good and\\nhard, and he'll go back into virtuousness, which is his nature when not\\ntravelling with Trampas.”\\n\\nSteve's voice sounded hard now. “You have caught Ed and me. That should\\nsatisfy you for one gather.”\\n\\n“Well, we think different, Steve. Trampas escaping leaves this thing\\nunfinished.”\\n\\n“So Trampas escaped too, did he?” said the prisoner.\\n\\n“Yes, Steve, Trampas escaped--this time; and Shorty with him--this time.\\nWe know it most as well as if we'd seen them go. And we're glad Shorty\\nis loose, for he'll build another fire or do some other foolishness next\\ntime, and that's the time we'll get Trampas.”\\n\\nTheir talk drifted to other points, and I lay thinking of the skirmish\\nthat had played beneath the surface of their banter. Yes, the joke, as\\nthey put it, was on Steve. He had lost one point in the game to them.\\nThey were playing for names. He, being a chivalrous thief, was playing\\nto hide names. They could only, among several likely confederates, guess\\nTrampas and Shorty. So it had been a slip for him to curse the man\\nwho built the fire. At least, they so held it. For, they with subtlety\\nreasoned, one curses the absent. And I agreed with them that Ed did not\\nknow how to lie well; he should have at once claimed the disgrace\\nof having spoiled the expedition. If Shorty was the blunderer, then\\ncertainly Trampas was the other man; for the two were as inseparable as\\ndon and master. Trampas had enticed Shorty away from good, and trained\\nhim in evil. It now struck me that after his single remark the Virginian\\nhad been silent throughout their shrewd discussion.\\n\\nIt was the other prisoner that I heard them next address. “You don't eat\\nany breakfast, Ed.”\\n\\n“Brace up, Ed. Look at Steve, how hardy he eats!”\\n\\nBut Ed, it seemed, wanted no breakfast. And the tin dishes rattled as\\nthey were gathered and taken to be packed.\\n\\n“Drink this coffee, anyway,” another urged; “you'll feel warmer.”\\n\\nThese words almost made it seem like my own execution. My whole body\\nturned cold in company with the prisoner's, and as if with a clank the\\nsituation tightened throughout my senses.\\n\\n“I reckon if every one's ready we'll start.” It was the Virginian's\\nvoice once more, and different from the rest. I heard them rise at his\\nbidding, and I put the blanket over my head. I felt their tread as they\\nwalked out, passing my stall. The straw that was half under me and half\\nout in the stable was stirred as by something heavy dragged or half\\nlifted along over it. “Look out, you're hurting Ed's arm,” one said to\\nanother, as the steps with tangled sounds passed slowly out. I heard\\nanother among those who followed say, “Poor Ed couldn't swallow his\\ncoffee.” Outside they began getting on their horses; and next their\\nhoofs grew distant, until all was silence round the stable except the\\ndull, even falling of the rain.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXXI. THE COTTONWOODS\\n\\n\\nI do not know how long I stayed there alone. It was the Virginian who\\ncame back, and as he stood at the foot of my blankets his eye, after\\nmeeting mine full for a moment, turned aside. I had never seen him\\nlook as he did now, not even in Pitchstone Canyon when we came upon the\\nbodies of Hank and his wife. Until this moment we had found no chance of\\nspeaking together, except in the presence of others.\\n\\n“Seems to be raining still,” I began after a little.\\n\\n“Yes. It's a wet spell.”\\n\\nHe stared out of the door, smoothing his mustache.\\n\\nIt was again I that spoke. “What time is it?”\\n\\nHe brooded over his watch. “Twelve minutes to seven.”\\n\\nI rose and stood drawing on my clothes.\\n\\n“The fire's out,” said he; and he assembled some new sticks over the\\nashes. Presently he looked round with a cup.\\n\\n“Never mind that for me,” I said.\\n\\n“We've a long ride,” he suggested.\\n\\n“I know. I've crackers in my pocket.”\\n\\nMy boots being pulled on, I walked to the door and watched the clouds.\\n“They seem as if they might lift,” I said. And I took out my watch.\\n\\n“What time is it?” he asked.\\n\\n“A quarter of--it's run down.”\\n\\nWhile I wound it he seemed to be consulting his own.\\n\\n“Well?” I inquired.\\n\\n“Ten minutes past seven.”\\n\\nAs I was setting my watch he slowly said:\\n\\n“Steve wound his all regular. I had to night-guard him till two.” His\\nspeech was like that of one in a trance: so, at least, it sounds in my\\nmemory to-day.\\n\\nAgain I looked at the weather and the rainy immensity of the plain. The\\nfoot-hills eastward where we were going were a soft yellow. Over the\\ngray-green sage-brush moved shapeless places of light--not yet the\\nuncovered sunlight, but spots where the storm was wearing thin; and\\nwandering streams of warmth passed by slowly in the surrounding air.\\nAs I watched the clouds and the earth, my eyes chanced to fall on the\\ndistant clump of cottonwoods. Vapors from the enfeebled storm floated\\nround them, and they were indeed far away; but I came inside and began\\nrolling up my blankets.\\n\\n“You will not change your mind?” said the Virginian by the fire. “It is\\nthirty-five miles.”\\n\\nI shook my head, feeling a certain shame that he should see how unnerved\\nI was.\\n\\nHe swallowed a hot cupful, and after it sat thinking; and presently he\\npassed his hand across his brow, shutting his eyes. Again he poured\\nout a cup, and emptying this, rose abruptly to his feet as if shaking\\nhimself free from something.\\n\\n“Let's pack and quit here,” he said.\\n\\nOur horses were in the corral and our belongings in the shelter of what\\nhad been once the cabin at this forlorn place. He collected them in\\nsilence while I saddled my own animal, and in silence we packed the two\\npackhorses, and threw the diamond hitch, and hauled tight the slack,\\ndamp ropes. Soon we had mounted, and as we turned into the trail I gave\\na look back at my last night's lodging.\\n\\nThe Virginian noticed me. “Good-by forever!” he interpreted.\\n\\n“By God, I hope so!”\\n\\n“Same here,” he confessed. And these were our first natural words this\\nmorning.\\n\\n“This will go well,” said I, holding my flask out to him; and both of us\\ntook some, and felt easier for it and the natural words.\\n\\nFor an hour we had been shirking real talk, holding fast to the weather,\\nor anything, and all the while that silent thing we were keeping\\noff spoke plainly in the air around us and in every syllable that we\\nuttered. But now we were going to get away from it; leave it behind in\\nthe stable, and set ourselves free from it by talking it out. Already\\nrelief had begun to stir in my spirits.\\n\\n“You never did this before,” I said.\\n\\n“No. I never had it to do.” He was riding beside me, looking down at his\\nsaddle-horn.\\n\\n“I do not think I should ever be able,” I pursued.\\n\\nDefiance sounded in his answer. “I would do it again this morning.”\\n\\n“Oh, I don't mean that. It's all right here. There's no other way.”\\n\\n“I would do it all over again the same this morning. Just the same.”\\n\\n“Why, so should I--if I could do it at all.” I still thought he was\\njustifying their justice to me.\\n\\nHe made no answer as he rode along, looking all the while at his saddle.\\nBut again he passed his hand over his forehead with that frown and\\nshutting of the eyes.\\n\\n“I should like to be sure I should behave myself if I were condemned,” I\\nsaid next. For it now came to me--which should I resemble? Could I read\\nthe newspaper, and be interested in county elections, and discuss coming\\ndeath as if I had lost a game of cards? Or would they have to drag me\\nout? That poor wretch in the gray flannel shirt--“It was bad in the\\nstable,” I said aloud. For an after-shiver of it went through me.\\n\\nA third time his hand brushed his forehead, and I ventured some\\nsympathy.\\n\\n“I'm afraid your head aches.”\\n\\n“I don't want to keep seeing Steve,” he muttered.\\n\\n“Steve!” I was astounded. “Why he--why all I saw of him was splendid.\\nSince it had to be. It was--”\\n\\n“Oh, yes; Ed. You're thinking about him. I'd forgot him. So you didn't\\nenjoy Ed?”\\n\\nAt this I looked at him blankly. “It isn't possible that--”\\n\\nAgain he cut me short with a laugh almost savage. “You needn't to worry\\nabout Steve. He stayed game.”\\n\\nWhat then had been the matter that he should keep seeing Steve--that his\\nvision should so obliterate from him what I still shivered at, and so\\nshake him now? For he seemed to be growing more stirred as I grew less.\\nI asked him no further questions, however, and we went on for several\\nminutes, he brooding always in the same fashion, until he resumed with\\nthe hard indifference that had before surprised me:-- “So Ed gave you\\nfeelings! Dumb ague and so forth.”\\n\\n“No doubt we're not made the same way,” I retorted.\\n\\nHe took no notice of this. “And you'd have been more comfortable if he'd\\nacted same as Steve did. It cert'nly was bad seeing Ed take it that way,\\nI reckon. And you didn't see him when the time came for business.\\nWell, here's what it is: a man may be such a confirmed miscreant that\\nkilling's the only cure for him; but still he's your own species, and\\nyou don't want to have him fall around and grab your laigs and show you\\nhis fear naked. It makes you feel ashamed. So Ed gave you feelings, and\\nSteve made everything right easy for you!” There was irony in his voice\\nas he surveyed me, but it fell away at once into sadness. “Both was\\nmiscreants. But if Steve had played the coward, too, it would have been\\na whole heap easier for me.” He paused before adding, “And Steve was not\\na miscreant once.”\\n\\nHis voice had trembled, and I felt the deep emotion that seemed to gain\\nupon him now that action was over and he had nothing to do but think.\\nAnd his view was simple enough: you must die brave. Failure is a sort\\nof treason to the brotherhood, and forfeits pity. It was Steve's perfect\\nbearing that had caught his heart so that he forgot even his scorn of\\nthe other man.\\n\\nBut this was by no means all that was to come. He harked back to that\\nnotion of a prisoner helping to make it easy for his executioner.\\n“Easy plumb to the end,” he pursued, his mind reviewing the acts of the\\nmorning. “Why, he tried to give me your newspaper. I didn't--”\\n\\n“Oh, no,” I said hastily. “I had finished with it.”\\n\\n“Well, he took dying as naturally as he took living. Like a man should.\\nLike I hope to.” Again he looked at the pictures in his mind. “No\\nplay-acting nor last words. He just told good-by to the boys as we led\\nhis horse under the limb--you needn't to look so dainty,” he broke off.\\n“You ain't going to get any more shocking particulars.”\\n\\n“I know I'm white-livered,” I said with a species of laugh. “I never\\ncrowd and stare when somebody is hurt in the street. I get away.”\\n\\nHe thought this over. “You don't mean all of that. You'd not have spoke\\njust that way about crowding and staring if you thought well of them\\nthat stare. Staring ain't courage; it's trashy curiosity. Now you did\\nnot have this thing--”\\n\\nHe had stretched out his hand to point, but it fell, and his utterance\\nstopped, and he jerked his horse to a stand. My nerves sprang like a\\nwire at his suddenness, and I looked where he was looking. There were\\nthe cottonwoods, close in front of us. As we had travelled and talked\\nwe had forgotten them. Now they were looming within a hundred yards; and\\nour trail lay straight through them.\\n\\n“Let's go around them,” said the Virginian.\\n\\nWhen we had come back from our circuit into the trail he continued:\\n“You did not have that thing to do. But a man goes through with his\\nresponsibilities--and I reckon you could.”\\n\\n“I hope so,” I answered. “How about Ed?”\\n\\n“He was not a man, though we thought he was till this. Steve and I\\nstarted punching cattle together at the Bordeaux outfit, north of\\nCheyenne. We did everything together in those days--work and play. Six\\nyears ago. Steve had many good points onced.”\\n\\nWe must have gone two miles before he spoke again. “You prob'ly didn't\\nnotice Steve? I mean the way he acted to me?” It was a question, but he\\ndid not wait for my answer. “Steve never said a word to me all through.\\nHe shunned it. And you saw how neighborly he talked to the other boys.”\\n\\n“Where have they all gone?” I asked.\\n\\nHe smiled at me. “It cert'nly is lonesome now, for a fact.”\\n\\n“I didn't know you felt it,” said I.\\n\\n“Feel it!--they've went to the railroad. Three of them are witnesses\\nin a case at Evanston, and the Judge wants our outfit at Medicine Bow.\\nSteve shunned me. Did he think I was going back on him?”\\n\\n“What if he did? You were not. And so nobody's going to Wind River but\\nyou?”\\n\\n“No. Did you notice Steve would not give us any information about\\nShorty? That was right. I would have acted that way, too.” Thus, each\\ntime, he brought me back to the subject.\\n\\nThe sun was now shining warm during two or three minutes together, and\\ngulfs of blue opened in the great white clouds. These moved and met\\namong each other, and parted, like hands spread out, slowly weaving\\na spell of sleep over the day after the wakeful night storm. The\\nhuge contours of the earth lay basking and drying, and not one living\\ncreature, bird or beast, was in sight. Quiet was returning to my revived\\nspirits, but there was none for the Virginian. And as he reasoned\\nmatters out aloud, his mood grew more overcast.\\n\\n“You have a friend, and his ways are your ways. You travel together,\\nyou spree together confidentially, and you suit each other down to the\\nground. Then one day you find him putting his iron on another man's\\ncalf. You tell him fair and square those ways have never been your ways\\nand ain't going to be your ways. Well, that does not change him any, for\\nit seems he's disturbed over getting rich quick and being a big man\\nin the Territory. And the years go on, until you are foreman of Judge\\nHenry's ranch and he--is dangling back in the cottonwoods. What can he\\nclaim? Who made the choice? He cannot say, 'Here is my old friend that I\\nwould have stood by.' Can he say that?”\\n\\n“But he didn't say it,” I protested.\\n\\n“No. He shunned me.”\\n\\n“Listen,” I said. “Suppose while you were on guard he had whispered,\\n'Get me off'--would you have done it?”\\n\\n“No, sir!” said the Virginian, hotly.\\n\\n“Then what do you want?” I asked. “What did you want?”\\n\\nHe could not answer me--but I had not answered him, I saw; so I pushed\\nit farther. “Did you want indorsement from the man you were hanging?\\nThat's asking a little too much.”\\n\\nBut he had now another confusion. “Steve stood by Shorty,” he said\\nmusingly. “It was Shorty's mistake cost him his life, but all the same\\nhe didn't want us to catch--”\\n\\n“You are mixing things,” I interrupted. “I never heard you mix things\\nbefore. And it was not Shorty's mistake.”\\n\\nHe showed momentary interest. “Whose then?”\\n\\n“The mistake of whoever took a fool into their enterprise.”\\n\\n“That's correct. Well, Trampas took Shorty in, and Steve would not tell\\non him either.”\\n\\nI still tried it, saying, “They were all in the same boat.” But logic\\nwas useless; he had lost his bearings in a fog of sentiment. He knew,\\nknew passionately, that he had done right; but the silence of his old\\nfriend to him through those last hours left a sting that no reasoning\\ncould assuage. “He told good-by to the rest of the boys; but not to me.”\\n And nothing that I could point out in common sense turned him from\\nthe thread of his own argument. He worked round the circle again to\\nself-justification. “Was it him I was deserting? Was not the deserting\\ndone by him the day I spoke my mind about stealing calves? I have kept\\nmy ways the same. He is the one that took to new ones. The man I used to\\ntravel with is not the man back there. Same name, to be sure. And same\\nbody. But different in--and yet he had the memory! You can't never\\nchange your memory!”\\n\\nHe gave a sob. It was the first I had ever heard from him, and before\\nI knew what I was doing I had reined my horse up to his and put my arm\\naround his shoulders. I had no sooner touched him than he was utterly\\novercome. “I knew Steve awful well,” he said.\\n\\nThus we had actually come to change places; for early in the morning he\\nhad been firm while I was unnerved, while now it was I who attempted to\\nsteady and comfort him.\\n\\nI had the sense to keep silent, and presently he shook my hand, not\\nlooking at me as he did so. He was always very shy of demonstration.\\nAnd he took to patting the neck of his pony. “You Monte hawss,” said he,\\n“you think you are wise, but there's a lot of things you don't savvy.”\\n Then he made a new beginning of talk between us.\\n\\n“It is kind of pitiful about Shorty.”\\n\\n“Very pitiful,” I said.\\n\\n“Do you know about him?” the Virginian asked.\\n\\n“I know there's no real harm in him, and some real good, and that he has\\nnot got the brains necessary to be a horse thief.”\\n\\n“That's so. That's very true. Trampas has led him in deeper than his\\nstature can stand. Now back East you can be middling and get along. But\\nif you go to try a thing on in this Western country, you've got to do it\\nWELL. You've got to deal cyards WELL; you've got to steal WELL; and if\\nyou claim to be quick with your gun, you must be quick, for you're a\\npublic temptation, and some man will not resist trying to prove he is\\nthe quicker. You must break all the Commandments WELL in this Western\\ncountry, and Shorty should have stayed in Brooklyn, for he will be a\\nnovice his livelong days. You don't know about him? He has told me his\\ncircumstances. He don't remember his father, and it was like he could\\nhave claimed three or four. And I expect his mother was not much\\ninterested in him before or after he was born. He ran around, and when\\nhe was eighteen he got to be help to a grocery man. But a girl he ran\\nwith kept taking all his pay and teasing him for more, and so one day\\nthe grocery man caught Shorty robbing his till, and fired him. There\\nwasn't no one to tell good-by to, for the girl had to go to the country\\nto see her aunt, she said. So Shorty hung around the store and kissed\\nthe grocery cat good-by. He'd been used to feeding the cat, and she'd\\nsit in his lap and purr, he told me. He sends money back to that girl\\nnow. This hyeh country is no country for Shorty, for he will be a\\nconspicuous novice all his days.”\\n\\n“Perhaps he'll prefer honesty after his narrow shave,” I said.\\n\\nBut the Virginian shook his head. “Trampas has got hold of him.”\\n\\nThe day was now all blue above, and all warm and dry beneath. We had\\nbegun to wind in and rise among the first slopes of the foot-hills, and\\nwe had talked ourselves into silence. At the first running water we made\\na long nooning, and I slept on the bare ground. My body was lodged so\\nfast and deep in slumber that when the Virginian shook me awake I could\\nnot come back to life at once; it was the clump of cottonwoods, small\\nand far out in the plain below us, that recalled me.\\n\\n“It'll not be watching us much longer,” said the Virginian. He made it\\na sort of joke; but I knew that both of us were glad when presently we\\nrode into a steeper country, and among its folds and carvings lost all\\nsight of the plain. He had not slept, I found. His explanation was that\\nthe packs needed better balancing, and after that he had gone up and\\ndown the stream on the chance of trout. But his haunted eyes gave me the\\nreal reason--they spoke of Steve, no matter what he spoke of; it was to\\nbe no short thing with him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXXII. SUPERSTITION TRAIL\\n\\n\\nWe did not make thirty-five miles that day, nor yet twenty-five, for\\nhe had let me sleep. We made an early camp and tried some unsuccessful\\nfishing, over which he was cheerful, promising trout to-morrow when we\\nshould be higher among the mountains. He never again touched or came\\nnear the subject that was on his mind, but while I sat writing my diary,\\nhe went off to his horse Monte, and I could hear that he occasionally\\ntalked to that friend.\\n\\nNext day we swung southward from what is known to many as the Conant\\ntrail, and headed for that short cut through the Tetons which is known\\nto but a few. Bitch Creek was the name of the stream we now followed,\\nand here there was such good fishing that we idled; and the horses and\\nI at least enjoyed ourselves. For they found fresh pastures and shade in\\nthe now plentiful woods; and the mountain odors and the mountain heights\\nwere enough for me when the fish refused to rise. This road of ours now\\nbecame the road which the pursuit had taken before the capture. Going\\nalong, I noticed the footprints of many hoofs, rain-blurred but recent,\\nand these were the tracks of the people I had met in the stable.\\n\\n“You can notice Monte's,” said the Virginian. “He is the only one that\\nhas his hind feet shod. There's several trails from this point down to\\nwhere we have come from.”\\n\\nWe mounted now over a long slant of rock, smooth and of wide extent.\\nAbove us it went up easily into a little side canyon, but ahead, where\\nour way was, it grew so steep that we got off and led our horses.\\nThis brought us to the next higher level of the mountain, a space of\\nsagebrush more open, where the rain-washed tracks appeared again in the\\nsofter ground.\\n\\n“Some one has been here since the rain,” I called to the Virginian, who\\nwas still on the rock, walking up behind the packhorses.\\n\\n“Since the rain!” he exclaimed. “That's not two days yet.” He came and\\nexamined the footprints. “A man and a hawss,” he said, frowning. “Going\\nthe same way we are. How did he come to pass us, and us not see him?”\\n\\n“One of the other trails,” I reminded him.\\n\\n“Yes, but there's not many that knows them. They are pretty rough\\ntrails.”\\n\\n“Worse than this one we're taking?”\\n\\n“Not much; only how does he come to know any of them? And why don't he\\ntake the Conant trail that's open and easy and not much longer? One man\\nand a hawss. I don't see who he is or what he wants here.”\\n\\n“Probably a prospector,” I suggested.\\n\\n“Only one outfit of prospectors has ever been here, and they claimed\\nthere was no mineral-bearing rock in these parts.”\\n\\nWe got back into our saddles with the mystery unsolved. To the Virginian\\nit was a greater one, apparently, than to me; why should one have to\\naccount for every stray traveller in the mountains?\\n\\n“That's queer, too,” said the Virginian. He was now riding in front of\\nme, and he stopped, looking down at the trail. “Don't you notice?”\\n\\nIt did not strike me.\\n\\n“Why, he keeps walking beside his hawss; he don't get on him.”\\n\\nNow we, of course, had mounted at the beginning of the better trail\\nafter the steep rock, and that was quite half a mile back. Still, I had\\na natural explanation. “He's leading a packhorse. He's a poor trapper,\\nand walks.”\\n\\n“Packhorses ain't usually shod before and behind,” said the Virginian;\\nand sliding to the ground he touched the footprints. “They are not four\\nhours old,” said he. “This bank's in shadow by one o'clock, and the sun\\nhas not cooked them dusty.”\\n\\nWe continued on our way; and although it seemed no very particular\\nthing to me that a man should choose to walk and lead his horse for a\\nwhile,--I often did so to limber my muscles,--nevertheless I began to\\ncatch the Virginian's uncertain feeling about this traveller whose steps\\nhad appeared on our path in mid-journey, as if he had alighted from the\\nmid-air, and to remind myself that he had come over the great face of\\nrock from another trail and thus joined us, and that indigent trappers\\nare to be found owning but a single horse and leading him with their\\nbelongings through the deepest solitudes of the mountains--none of this\\nquite brought back to me the comfort which had been mine since we left\\nthe cottonwoods out of sight down in the plain. Hence I called out\\nsharply, “What's the matter now?” when the Virginian suddenly stopped\\nhis horse again.\\n\\nHe looked down at the trail, and then he very slowly turned round in his\\nsaddle and stared back steadily at me. “There's two of them,” he said.\\n\\n“Two what?”\\n\\n“I don't know.”\\n\\n“You must know whether it's two horses or two men,” I said, almost\\nangrily.\\n\\nBut to this he made no answer, sitting quite still on his horse and\\ncontemplating the ground. The silence was fastening on me like a spell,\\nand I spurred my horse impatiently forward to see for myself. The\\nfootprints of two men were there in the trail.\\n\\n“What do you say to that?” said the Virginian. “Kind of ridiculous,\\nain't it?”\\n\\n“Very quaint,” I answered, groping for the explanation. There was no\\nrock here to walk over and step from into the softer trail. These second\\nsteps came more out of the air than the first. And my brain played me\\nthe evil trick of showing me a dead man in a gray flannel shirt.\\n\\n“It's two, you see, travelling with one hawss, and they take turns\\nriding him.”\\n\\n“Why, of course!” I exclaimed; and we went along for a few paces.\\n\\n“There you are,” said the Virginian, as the trail proved him right.\\n“Number one has got on. My God, what's that?”\\n\\nAt a crashing in the woods very close to us we both flung round and\\ncaught sight of a vanishing elk.\\n\\nIt left us confronted, smiling a little, and sounding each other with\\nour eyes. “Well, we didn't need him for meat,” said the Virginian.\\n\\n“A spike-horn, wasn't it?” said I.\\n\\n“Yes, just a spike-horn.”\\n\\nFor a while now as we rode we kept up a cheerful conversation about elk.\\nWe wondered if we should meet many more close to the trail like this;\\nbut it was not long before our words died away. We had come into a\\nveritable gulf of mountain peaks, sharp at their bare summits like\\nteeth, holding fields of snow lower down, and glittering still in full\\nday up there, while down among our pines and parks the afternoon was\\ngrowing sombre. All the while the fresh hoofprints of the horse and the\\nfresh footprints of the man preceded us. In the trees, and in the opens,\\nacross the levels, and up the steeps, they were there. And so they were\\nnot four hours old! Were they so much? Might we not, round some turn,\\ncome upon the makers of them? I began to watch for this. And again my\\nbrain played me an evil trick, against which I found myself actually\\nreasoning thus: if they took turns riding, then walking must tire them\\nas it did me or any man. And besides, there was a horse. With such\\nthoughts I combated the fancy that those footprints were being made\\nimmediately in front of us all the while, and that they were the only\\nsign of any presence which our eyes could see. But my fancy overcame my\\nthoughts. It was shame only which held me from asking this question of\\nthe Virginian: Had one horse served in both cases of Justice down at\\nthe cottonwoods? I wondered about this. One horse--or had the strangling\\nnooses dragged two saddles empty at the same signal? Most likely; and\\ntherefore these people up here--Was I going back to the nursery? I\\nbrought myself up short. And I told myself to be steady; there lurked in\\nthis brain-process which was going on beneath my reason a threat worse\\nthan the childish apprehensions it created. I reminded myself that I was\\na man grown, twenty-five years old, and that I must not merely seem like\\none, but feel like one. “You're not afraid of the dark, I suppose?” This\\nI uttered aloud, unwittingly.\\n\\n“What's that?”\\n\\nI started; but it was only the Virginian behind me. “Oh, nothing. The\\nair is getting colder up here.”\\n\\nI had presently a great relief. We came to a place where again this\\ntrail mounted so abruptly that we once more got off to lead our\\nhorses. So likewise had our predecessors done; and as I watched the two\\ndifferent sets of footprints, I observed something and hastened to speak\\nof it.\\n\\n“One man is much heavier than the other.”\\n\\n“I was hoping I'd not have to tell you that,” said the Virginian.\\n\\n“You're always ahead of me! Well, still my education is progressing.”\\n\\n“Why, yes. You'll equal an Injun if you keep on.”\\n\\nIt was good to be facetious; and I smiled to myself as I trudged upward.\\nWe came off the steep place, leaving the canyon beneath us, and took to\\nhorseback. And as we proceeded over the final gentle slant up to the\\nrim of the great basin that was set among the peaks, the Virginian was\\njocular once more.\\n\\n“Pounds has got on,” said he, “and Ounces is walking.”\\n\\nI glanced over my shoulder at him, and he nodded as he fixed the\\nweather-beaten crimson handkerchief round his neck. Then he threw\\na stone at a pack animal that was delaying on the trail. “Damn your\\nbuckskin hide,” he drawled. “You can view the scenery from the top.”\\n\\nHe was so natural, sitting loose in the saddle, and cursing in his\\ngentle voice, that I laughed to think what visions I had been harboring.\\nThe two dead men riding one horse through the mountains vanished, and I\\ncame back to every day.\\n\\n“Do you think we'll catch up with those people?” I asked.\\n\\n“Not likely. They're travelling about the same gait we are.”\\n\\n“Ounces ought to be the best walker.”\\n\\n“Up hill, yes. But Pounds will go down a-foggin'.”\\n\\nWe gained the rim of the basin. It lay below us, a great cup of\\ncountry,--rocks, woods, opens, and streams. The tall peaks rose like\\nspires around it, magnificent and bare in the last of the sun; and we\\nsurveyed this upper world, letting our animals get breath. Our bleak,\\ncrumbled rim ran like a rampart between the towering tops, a half circle\\nof five miles or six, very wide in some parts, and in some shrinking to\\na scanty foothold, as here. Here our trail crossed over it between two\\neroded and fantastic shapes of stone, like mushrooms, or misshapen heads\\non pikes. Banks of snow spread up here against the black rocks, but\\nhalf an hour would see us descended to the green and the woods. I looked\\ndown, both of us looked down, but our forerunners were not there.\\n\\n“They'll be camping somewhere in this basin, though,” said the\\nVirginian, staring at the dark pines. “They have not come this trail by\\naccident.”\\n\\nA cold little wind blew down between our stone shapes, and upward again,\\neddying. And round a corner upward with it came fluttering a leaf of\\nnewspaper, and caught against an edge close to me.\\n\\n“What's the latest?” inquired the Virginian from his horse. For I had\\ndismounted, and had picked up the leaf.\\n\\n“Seems to be interesting,” I next heard him say. “Can't you tell a man\\nwhat's making your eyes bug out so?”\\n\\n“Yes,” my voice replied to him, and it sounded like some stranger\\nspeaking lightly near by; “oh, yes! Decidedly interesting.” My voice\\nmimicked his pronunciation. “It's quite the latest, I imagine. You had\\nbetter read it yourself.” And I handed it to him with a smile, watching\\nhis countenance, while my brain felt as if clouds were rushing through\\nit.\\n\\nI saw his eyes quietly run the headings over. “Well?” he inquired,\\nafter scanning it on both sides. “I don't seem to catch the excitement.\\nFremont County is going to hold elections. I see they claim Jake--”\\n\\n“It's mine,” I cut him off. “My own paper. Those are my pencil marks.”\\n\\nI do not think that a microscope could have discerned a change in\\nhis face. “Oh,” he commented, holding the paper, and fixing it with a\\ncritical eye. “You mean this is the one you lent Steve, and he wanted\\nto give me to give back to you. And so them are your own marks.” For a\\nmoment more he held it judicially, as I have seen men hold a contract\\nupon whose terms they were finally passing. “Well, you have got it back\\nnow, anyway.” And he handed it to me.\\n\\n“Only a piece of it!” I exclaimed, always lightly. And as I took it from\\nhim his hand chanced to touch mine. It was cold as ice.\\n\\n“They ain't through readin' the rest,” he explained easily. “Don't you\\nthrow it away! After they've taken such trouble.”\\n\\n“That's true,” I answered. “I wonder if it's Pounds or Ounces I'm\\nindebted to.”\\n\\nThus we made further merriment as we rode down into the great basin.\\nBefore us, the horse and boot tracks showed plain in the soft slough\\nwhere melted snow ran half the day.\\n\\n“If it's a paper chase,” said the Virginian, “they'll drop no more along\\nhere.”\\n\\n“Unless it gets dark,” said I.\\n\\n“We'll camp before that. Maybe we'll see their fire.”\\n\\nWe did not see their fire. We descended in the chill silence, while the\\nmushroom rocks grew far and the sombre woods approached. By a stream we\\ngot off where two banks sheltered us; for a bleak wind cut down over the\\ncrags now and then, making the pines send out a great note through the\\nbasin, like breakers in a heavy sea. But we made cosey in the tent.\\nWe pitched the tent this night, and I was glad to have it shut out the\\nmountain peaks. They showed above the banks where we camped; and in the\\nstarlight their black shapes rose stark against the sky. They, with the\\npines and the wind, were a bedroom too unearthly this night. And as soon\\nas our supper dishes were washed we went inside to our lantern and our\\ngame of cribbage.\\n\\n“This is snug,” said the Virginian, as we played. “That wind don't get\\ndown here.”\\n\\n“Smoking is snug, too,” said I. And we marked our points for an hour,\\nwith no words save about the cards.\\n\\n“I'll be pretty near glad when we get out of these mountains,” said the\\nVirginian. “They're most too big.”\\n\\nThe pines had altogether ceased; but their silence was as tremendous as\\ntheir roar had been.\\n\\n“I don't know, though,” he resumed. “There's times when the plains can\\nbe awful big, too.”\\n\\nPresently we finished a hand, and he said, “Let me see that paper.”\\n\\nHe sat reading it apparently through, while I arranged my blankets to\\nmake a warm bed. Then, since the paper continued to absorb him, I got\\nmyself ready, and slid between my blankets for the night. “You'll need\\nanother candle soon in that lantern,” said I.\\n\\nHe put the paper down. “I would do it all over again,” he began. “The\\nwhole thing just the same. He knowed the customs of the country, and he\\nplayed the game. No call to blame me for the customs of the country. You\\nleave other folks' cattle alone, or you take the consequences, and it\\nwas all known to Steve from the start. Would he have me take the Judge's\\nwages and give him the wink? He must have changed a heap from the Steve\\nI knew if he expected that. I don't believe he expected that. He knew\\nwell enough the only thing that would have let him off would have been\\na regular jury. For the thieves have got hold of the juries in Johnson\\nCounty. I would do it all over, just the same.”\\n\\nThe expiring flame leaped in the lantern, and fell blue. He broke off\\nin his words as if to arrange the light, but did not, sitting silent\\ninstead, just visible, and seeming to watch the death struggle of the\\nflame. I could find nothing to say to him, and I believed he was now\\nwinning his way back to serenity by himself. He kept his outward man\\nso nearly natural that I forgot about that cold touch of his hand, and\\nnever guessed how far out from reason the tide of emotion was even now\\nwhirling him. “I remember at Cheyenne onced,” he resumed. And he told\\nme of a Thanksgiving visit to town that he had made with Steve. “We\\nwas just colts then,” he said. He dwelt on their coltish doings, their\\nadventures sought and wrought in the perfect fellowship of youth. “For\\nSteve and me most always hunted in couples back in them gamesome years,”\\n he explained. And he fell into the elemental talk of sex, such talk\\nas would be an elk's or tiger's; and spoken so by him, simply and\\nnaturally, as we speak of the seasons, or of death, or of any actuality,\\nit was without offense. It would be offense should I repeat it. Then,\\nabruptly ending these memories of himself and Steve, he went out of the\\ntent, and I heard him dragging a log to the fire. When it had blazed up,\\nthere on the tent wall was his shadow and that of the log where he sat\\nwith his half-broken heart. And all the while I supposed he was master\\nof himself, and self-justified against Steve's omission to bid him\\ngood-by.\\n\\nI must have fallen asleep before he returned, for I remember nothing\\nexcept waking and finding him in his blankets beside me. The fire\\nshadow was gone, and gray, cold light was dimly on the tent. He slept\\nrestlessly, and his forehead was ploughed by lines of pain. While I\\nlooked at him he began to mutter, and suddenly started up with violence.\\n“No!” he cried out; “no! Just the same!” and thus wakened himself,\\nstaring. “What's the matter?” he demanded. He was slow in getting back\\nto where we were; and full consciousness found him sitting up with his\\neyes fixed on mine. They were more haunted than they had been at all,\\nand his next speech came straight from his dream. “Maybe you'd better\\nquit me. This ain't your trouble.”\\n\\nI laughed. “Why, what is the trouble?”\\n\\nHis eyes still intently fixed on mine. “Do you think if we changed our\\ntrail we could lose them from us?”\\n\\nI was framing a jocose reply about Ounces being a good walker, when the\\nsound of hoofs rushing in the distance stopped me, and he ran out of the\\ntent with his rifle. When I followed with mine he was up the bank, and\\nall his powers alert. But nothing came out of the dimness save our three\\nstampeded horses. They crashed over fallen timber and across the open to\\nwhere their picketed comrade grazed at the end of his rope. By him they\\ncame to a stand, and told him, I suppose, what they had seen; for all\\nfour now faced in the same direction, looking away into the mysterious\\ndawn. We likewise stood peering, and my rifle barrel felt cold in my\\nhand. The dawn was all we saw, the inscrutable dawn, coming and coming\\nthrough the black pines and the gray open of the basin. There above\\nlifted the peaks, no sun yet on them, and behind us our stream made a\\nlittle tinkling.\\n\\n“A bear, I suppose,” said I, at length.\\n\\nHis strange look fixed me again, and then his eyes went to the horses.\\n“They smell things we can't smell,” said he, very slowly. “Will you\\nprove to me they don't see things we can't see?”\\n\\nA chill shot through me, and I could not help a frightened glance where\\nwe had been watching. But one of the horses began to graze and I had\\na wholesome thought. “He's tired of whatever he sees, then,” said I,\\npointing.\\n\\nA smile came for a moment in the Virginian's face. “Must be a poor\\nshow,” he observed. All the horses were grazing now, and he added, “It\\nain't hurt their appetites any.”\\n\\nWe made our own breakfast then. And what uncanny dread I may have been\\ntouched with up to this time henceforth left me in the face of a real\\nalarm. The shock of Steve was working upon the Virginian. He was aware\\nof it himself; he was fighting it with all his might; and he was being\\novercome. He was indeed like a gallant swimmer against whom both wind\\nand tide have conspired. And in this now foreboding solitude there was\\nonly myself to throw him ropes. His strokes for safety were as bold as\\nwas the undertow that ceaselessly annulled them.\\n\\n“I reckon I made a fuss in the tent?” said he, feeling his way with me.\\n\\nI threw him a rope. “Yes. Nightmare--indigestion--too much newspaper\\nbefore retiring.”\\n\\nHe caught the rope. “That's correct! I had a hell of a foolish dream for\\na growed-up man. You'd not think it of me.”\\n\\n“Oh, yes, I should. I've had them after prolonged lobster and\\nchampagne.”\\n\\n“Ah,” he murmured, “prolonged! Prolonged is what does it.” He glanced\\nbehind him. “Steve came back--”\\n\\n“In your lobster dream,” I put in.\\n\\nBut he missed this rope. “Yes,” he answered, with his eyes searching me.\\n“And he handed me the paper--”\\n\\n“By the way, where is that?” I asked.\\n\\n“I built the fire with it. But when I took it from him it was a\\nsix-shooter I had hold of, and pointing at my breast. And then Steve\\nspoke. 'Do you think you're fit to live?' Steve said; and I got hot at\\nhim, and I reckon I must have told him what I thought of him. You heard\\nme, I expect?”\\n\\n“Glad I didn't. Your language sometimes is--”\\n\\nHe laughed out. “Oh, I account for all this that's happening just like\\nyou do. If we gave our explanations, they'd be pretty near twins.”\\n\\n“The horses saw a bear, then?”\\n\\n“Maybe a bear. Maybe “--but here the tide caught him again--“What's your\\nidea about dreams?”\\n\\nMy ropes were all out. “Liver--nerves,” was the best I could do.\\n\\nBut now he swam strongly by himself.\\n\\n“You may think I'm discreditable,” he said, “but I know I am. It ought\\nto take more than--well, men have lost their friendships before. Feuds\\nand wars have cloven a right smart of bonds in twain. And if my haid\\nis going to get shook by a little old piece of newspaper--I'm ashamed I\\nburned that. I'm ashamed to have been that weak.”\\n\\n“Any man gets unstrung,” I told him. My ropes had become straws; and I\\nstrove to frame some policy for the next hours.\\n\\nWe now finished breakfast and set forth to catch the horses. As we drove\\nthem in I found that the Virginian was telling me a ghost story. “At\\nhalf-past three in the morning she saw her runaway daughter standing\\nwith a babe in her arms; but when she moved it was all gone. Later they\\nfound it was the very same hour the young mother died in Nogales. And\\nshe sent for the child and raised it herself. I knowed them both back\\nhome. Do you believe that?”\\n\\nI said nothing.\\n\\n“No more do I believe it,” he asserted. “And see here! Nogales time\\nis three hours different from Richmond. I didn't know about that point\\nthen.”\\n\\nOnce out of these mountains, I knew he could right himself; but even\\nI, who had no Steve to dream about, felt this silence of the peaks was\\npreying on me.\\n\\n“Her daughter and her might have been thinkin' mighty hard about each\\nother just then,” he pursued. “But Steve is dead. Finished. You cert'nly\\ndon't believe there's anything more?”\\n\\n“I wish I could,” I told him.\\n\\n“No, I'm satisfied. Heaven didn't never interest me much. But if there\\nwas a world of dreams after you went--” He stopped himself and turned\\nhis searching eyes away from mine. “There's a heap o' darkness wherever\\nyou try to step,” he said, “and I thought I'd left off wasting thoughts\\non the subject. You see”--he dexterously roped a horse, and once more\\nhis splendid sanity was turned to gold by his imagination--“I expect\\nin many growed-up men you'd call sensible there's a little boy\\nsleepin'--the little kid they onced was--that still keeps his fear\\nof the dark. You mentioned the dark yourself yesterday. Well, this\\nexperience has woke up that kid in me, and blamed if I can coax the\\nlittle cuss to go to sleep again! I keep a-telling him daylight will\\nsure come, but he keeps a-crying and holding on to me.”\\n\\nSomewhere far in the basin there was a faint sound, and we stood still.\\n\\n“Hush!” he said.\\n\\nBut it was like our watching the dawn; nothing more followed.\\n\\n“They have shot that bear,” I remarked.\\n\\nHe did not answer, and we put the saddles on without talk. We made no\\nhaste, but we were not over half an hour, I suppose, in getting off with\\nthe packs. It was not a new thing to hear a shot where wild game was in\\nplenty; yet as we rode that shot sounded already in my mind different\\nfrom others. Perhaps I should not believe this to-day but for what I\\nlook back to. To make camp last night we had turned off the trail, and\\nnow followed the stream down for a while, taking next a cut through the\\nwood. In this way we came upon the tracks of our horses where they had\\nbeen galloping back to the camp after their fright. They had kicked up\\nthe damp and matted pine needles very plainly all along.\\n\\n“Nothing has been here but themselves, though,” said I.\\n\\n“And they ain't showing signs of remembering any scare,” said the\\nVirginian.\\n\\nIn a little while we emerged upon an open.\\n\\n“Here's where they was grazing,” said the Virginian; and the signs were\\nclear enough. “Here's where they must have got their scare,” he pursued.\\n“You stay with them while I circle a little.” So I stayed; and certainly\\nour animals were very calm at visiting this scene. When you bring a\\nhorse back to where he has recently encountered a wild animal his ears\\nand his nostrils are apt to be wide awake.\\n\\nThe Virginian had stopped and was beckoning to me.\\n\\n“Here's your bear,” said he, as I arrived. “Two-legged, you see. And he\\nhad a hawss of his own.” There was a stake driven down where an animal\\nhad been picketed for the night.\\n\\n“Looks like Ounces,” I said, considering the footprints.\\n\\n“It's Ounces. And Ounces wanted another hawss very bad, so him and\\nPounds could travel like gentlemen should.”\\n\\n“But Pounds doesn't seem to have been with him.”\\n\\n“Oh, Pounds, he was making coffee, somewheres in yonder, when this\\nhappened. Neither of them guessed there'd be other hawsses wandering\\nhere in the night, or they both would have come.” He turned back to our\\npack animals.\\n\\n“Then you'll not hunt for this camp to make sure?”\\n\\n“I prefer making sure first. We might be expected at that camp.”\\n\\nHe took out his rifle from beneath his leg and set it across his saddle\\nat half-cock. I did the same; and thus cautiously we resumed our journey\\nin a slightly different direction. “This ain't all we're going to find\\nout,” said the Virginian. “Ounces had a good idea; but I reckon he made\\na bad mistake later.”\\n\\nWe had found out a good deal without any more, I thought. Ounces had\\ngone to bring in their single horse, and coming upon three more in the\\npasture had undertaken to catch one and failed, merely driving them\\nwhere he feared to follow.\\n\\n“Shorty never could rope a horse alone,” I remarked.\\n\\nThe Virginian grinned. “Shorty? Well, Shorty sounds as well as Ounces.\\nBut that ain't the mistake I'm thinking he made.”\\n\\nI knew that he would not tell me, but that was just like him. For the\\nlast twenty minutes, having something to do, he had become himself\\nagain, had come to earth from that unsafe country of the brain where\\nbeckoned a spectral Steve. Nothing was left but in his eyes that\\nquestion which pain had set there; and I wondered if his friend of old,\\nwho seemed so brave and amiable, would have dealt him that hurt at the\\nsolemn end had he known what a poisoned wound it would be.\\n\\nWe came out on a ridge from which we could look down. “You always want\\nto ride on high places when there's folks around whose intentions ain't\\nbeen declared,” said the Virginian. And we went along our ridge for some\\ndistance. Then, suddenly he turned down and guided us almost at once to\\nthe trail. “That's it,” he said. “See.”\\n\\nThe track of a horse was very fresh on the trail. But it was a galloping\\nhorse now, and no bootprints were keeping up with it any more. No boots\\ncould have kept up with it. The rider was making time to-day. Yesterday\\nthat horse had been ridden up into the mountains at leisure. Who was on\\nhim? There was never to be any certain answer to that. But who was not\\non him? We turned back in our journey, back into the heart of that basin\\nwith the tall peaks all rising like teeth in the cloudless sun, and the\\nsnow-fields shining white.\\n\\n“He was afraid of us,” said the Virginian. “He did not know how many of\\nus had come up here. Three hawsses might mean a dozen more around.”\\n\\nWe followed the backward trail in among the pines, and came after a time\\nupon their camp. And then I understood the mistake that Shorty had made.\\nHe had returned after his failure, and had told that other man of the\\npresence of new horses. He should have kept this a secret; for haste had\\nto be made at once, and two cannot get away quickly upon one horse. But\\nit was poor Shorty's last blunder. He lay there by their extinct fire,\\nwith his wistful, lost-dog face upward, and his thick yellow hair\\nunparted as it had always been. The murder had been done from behind. We\\nclosed the eyes.\\n\\n“There was no natural harm in him,” said the Virginian. “But you must do\\na thing well in this country.”\\n\\nThere was not a trace, not a clew, of the other man; and we found a\\nplace where we could soon cover Shorty with earth. As we lifted him we\\nsaw the newspaper that he had been reading. He had brought it from the\\nclump of cottonwoods where he and the other man had made a later visit\\nthan ours to be sure of the fate of their friends--or possibly in hopes\\nof another horse. Evidently, when the party were surprised, they had\\nbeen able to escape with only one. All of the newspaper was there save\\nthe leaf I had picked up--all and more, for this had pencil writing on\\nit that was not mine, nor did I at first take it in. I thought it might\\nbe a clew, and I read it aloud. “Good-by, Jeff,” it said. “I could not\\nhave spoke to you without playing the baby.”\\n\\n“Who's Jeff?” I asked. But it came over me when I looked at the\\nVirginian. He was standing beside me quite motionless; and then he put\\nout his hand and took the paper, and stood still, looking at the words.\\n“Steve used to call me Jeff,” he said, “because I was Southern. I reckon\\nnobody else ever did.”\\n\\nHe slowly folded the message from the dead, brought by the dead, and\\nrolled it in the coat behind his saddle. For a half-minute he stood\\nleaning his forehead down against the saddle. After this he came back\\nand contemplated Shorty's face awhile. “I wish I could thank him,” he\\nsaid. “I wish I could.”\\n\\nWe carried Shorty over and covered him with earth, and on that laid a\\nfew pine branches; then we took up our journey, and by the end of the\\nforenoon we had gone some distance upon our trail through the Teton\\nMountains. But in front of us the hoofprints ever held their stride\\nof haste, drawing farther from us through the hours, until by the next\\nafternoon somewhere we noticed they were no longer to be seen; and after\\nthat they never came upon the trail again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXXIII. THE SPINSTER LOSES SOME SLEEP\\n\\n\\nSomewhere at the eastern base of the Tetons did those hoofprints\\ndisappear into a mountain sanctuary where many crooked paths have led.\\nHe that took another man's possessions, or he that took another man's\\nlife, could always run here if the law or popular justice were too hot\\nat his heels. Steep ranges and forests walled him in from the world on\\nall four sides, almost without a break; and every entrance lay through\\nintricate solitudes. Snake River came into the place through canyons\\nand mournful pines and marshes, to the north, and went out at the south\\nbetween formidable chasms. Every tributary to this stream rose among\\nhigh peaks and ridges, and descended into the valley by well-nigh\\nimpenetrable courses: Pacific Creek from Two Ocean Pass, Buffalo Fork\\nfrom no pass at all, Black Rock from the To-wo-ge-tee Pass--all these,\\nand many more, were the waters of loneliness, among whose thousand\\nhiding-places it was easy to be lost. Down in the bottom was a spread of\\nlevel land, broad and beautiful, with the blue and silver Tetons rising\\nfrom its chain of lakes to the west, and other heights presiding over\\nits other sides. And up and down and in and out of this hollow square of\\nmountains, where waters plentifully flowed, and game and natural pasture\\nabounded, there skulked a nomadic and distrustful population. This in\\ndue time built cabins, took wives, begot children, and came to speak of\\nitself as “The honest settlers of Jackson's Hole.” It is a commodious\\ntitle, and doubtless to-day more accurate than it was once.\\n\\nInto this place the hoofprints disappeared. Not many cabins were yet\\nbuilt there; but the unknown rider of the horse knew well that he would\\nfind shelter and welcome among the felons of his stripe. Law and order\\nmight guess his name correctly, but there was no next step, for lack of\\nevidence; and he would wait, whoever he was, until the rage of popular\\njustice, which had been pursuing him and his brother thieves, should\\nsubside. Then, feeling his way gradually with prudence, he would let\\nhimself be seen again.\\n\\nAnd now, as mysteriously as he had melted away, rumor passed over the\\ncountry. No tongue seemed to be heard telling the first news; the news\\nwas there, one day, a matter of whispered knowledge. On Sunk Creek and\\non Bear Creek, and elsewhere far and wide, before men talked men seemed\\nsecretly to know that Steve, and Ed, and Shorty, would never again be\\nseen. Riders met each other in the road and drew rein to discuss the\\nevent, and its bearing upon the cattle interests. In town saloons men\\ntook each other aside, and muttered over it in corners.\\n\\nThus it reached the ears of Molly Wood, beginning in a veiled and\\nharmless shape.\\n\\nA neighbor joined her when she was out riding by herself.\\n\\n“Good morning,” said he. “Don't you find it lonesome?” And when she\\nanswered lightly, he continued, meaning well: “You'll be having company\\nagain soon now. He has finished his job. Wish he'd finished it MORE!\\nWell, good day.”\\n\\nMolly thought these words over. She could not tell why they gave her\\na strange feeling. To her Vermont mind no suspicion of the truth would\\ncome naturally. But suspicion began to come when she returned from her\\nride. For, entering the cabin of the Taylors', she came upon several\\npeople who all dropped their talk short, and were not skilful at\\nresuming it. She sat there awhile, uneasily aware that all of them\\nknew something which she did not know, and was not intended to know. A\\nthought pierced her--had anything happened to her lover? No; that was\\nnot it. The man she had met on horseback spoke of her having company\\nsoon again. How soon? she wondered. He had been unable to say when\\nhe should return, and now she suddenly felt that a great silence had\\nenveloped him lately: not the mere silence of absence, of receiving\\nno messages or letters, but another sort of silence which now, at this\\nmoment, was weighing strangely upon her.\\n\\nAnd then the next day it came out at the schoolhouse. During that\\ninterval known as recess, she became aware through the open window that\\nthey were playing a new game outside. Lusty screeches of delight reached\\nher ears.\\n\\n“Jump!” a voice ordered. “Jump!”\\n\\n“I don't want to,” returned another voice, uneasily.\\n\\n“You said you would,” said several. “Didn't he say he would? Ah, he said\\nhe would. Jump now, quick!”\\n\\n“But I don't want to,” quavered the voice in a tone so dismal that Molly\\nwent out to see.\\n\\nThey had got Bob Carmody on the top of the gate by a tree, with a rope\\nround his neck, the other end of which four little boys were joyously\\nholding. The rest looked on eagerly, three little girls clasping their\\nhands, and springing up and down with excitement.\\n\\n“Why, children!” exclaimed Molly.\\n\\n“He's said his prayers and everything,” they all screamed out. “He's a\\nrustler, and we're lynchin' him. Jump, Bob!”\\n\\n“I don't want--”\\n\\n“Ah, coward, won't take his medicine!”\\n\\n“Let him go, boys,” said Molly. “You might really hurt him.” And so she\\nbroke up this game, but not without general protest from Wyoming's young\\nvoice.\\n\\n“He said he would,” Henry Dow assured her.\\n\\nAnd George Taylor further explained: “He said he'd be Steve. But Steve\\ndidn't scare.” Then George proceeded to tell the schoolmarm, eagerly,\\nall about Steve and Ed, while the schoolmarm looked at him with a rigid\\nface.\\n\\n“You promised your mother you'd not tell,” said Henry Dow, after all\\nhad been told. “You've gone and done it,” and Henry wagged his head in a\\nsuperior manner.\\n\\nThus did the New England girl learn what her cow-boy lover had done. She\\nspoke of it to nobody; she kept her misery to herself. He was not there\\nto defend his act. Perhaps in a way that was better. But these were\\nhours of darkness indeed to Molly Wood.\\n\\nOn that visit to Dunbarton, when at the first sight of her lover's\\nphotograph in frontier dress her aunt had exclaimed, “I suppose there\\nare days when he does not kill people,” she had cried in all good faith\\nand mirth, “He never killed anybody!” Later, when he was lying in her\\ncabin weak from his bullet wound, but each day stronger beneath her\\nnursing, at a certain word of his there had gone through her a shudder\\nof doubt. Perhaps in his many wanderings he had done such a thing in\\nself-defence, or in the cause of popular justice. But she had pushed the\\nidea away from her hastily, back into the days before she had ever seen\\nhim. If this had ever happened, let her not know of it. Then, as a cruel\\nreward for his candor and his laying himself bare to her mother, the\\nletters from Bennington had used that very letter of his as a weapon\\nagainst him. Her sister Sarah had quoted from it. “He says with apparent\\npride,” wrote Sarah, “that he has never killed for pleasure or profit.'\\nThose are his exact words, and you may guess their dreadful effect upon\\nmother. I congratulate you, my dear, on having chosen a protector so\\nscrupulous.”\\n\\nThus her elder sister had seen fit to write; and letters from less near\\nrelatives made hints at the same subject. So she was compelled to accept\\nthis piece of knowledge thrust upon her. Yet still, still, those events\\nhad been before she knew him. They were remote, without detail or\\ncontext. He had been little more than a boy. No doubt it was to save his\\nown life. And so she bore the hurt of her discovery all the more easily\\nbecause her sister's tone roused her to defend her cow-boy.\\n\\nBut now!\\n\\nIn her cabin, alone, after midnight, she arose from her sleepless bed,\\nand lighting the candle, stood before his photograph.\\n\\n“It is a good face,” her great-aunt had said, after some study of it.\\nAnd these words were in her mind now. There his likeness stood at full\\nlength, confronting her: the spurs on the boots, the fringed leathern\\nchaparreros, the coiled rope in hand, the pistol at hip, the rough\\nflannel shirt, and the scarf knotted at the throat--and then the grave\\neyes, looking at her. It thrilled her to meet them, even so. She could\\nread life into them. She seemed to feel passion come from them, and then\\nsomething like reproach. She stood for a long while looking at him, and\\nthen, beating her hands together suddenly, she blew out her light and\\nwent back into bed, but not to sleep.\\n\\n“You're looking pale, deary,” said Mrs. Taylor to her, a few days later.\\n\\n“Am I?”\\n\\n“And you don't eat anything.”\\n\\n“Oh, yes, I do.” And Molly retired to her cabin.\\n\\n“George,” said Mrs. Taylor, “you come here.”\\n\\nIt may seem severe--I think that it was severe. That evening when\\nMr. Taylor came home to his family, George received a thrashing for\\ndisobedience.\\n\\n“And I suppose,” said Mrs. Taylor to her husband, “that she came out\\njust in time to stop 'em breaking Bob Carmody's neck for him.”\\n\\nUpon the day following Mrs. Taylor essayed the impossible. She took\\nherself over to Molly Wood's cabin. The girl gave her a listless\\ngreeting, and the dame sat slowly down, and surveyed the comfortable\\nroom.\\n\\n“A very nice home, deary,” said she, “if it was a home. But you'll fix\\nsomething like this in your real home, I have no doubt.”\\n\\nMolly made no answer.\\n\\n“What we're going to do without you I can't see,” said Mrs. Taylor.\\n“But I'd not have it different for worlds. He'll be coming back soon, I\\nexpect.”\\n\\n“Mrs. Taylor,” said Molly, all at once, “please don't say anything now.\\nI can't stand it.” And she broke into wretched tears.\\n\\n“Why, deary, he--”\\n\\n“No; not a word. Please, please--I'll go out if you do.”\\n\\nThe older woman went to the younger one, and then put her arms round\\nher. But when the tears were over, they had not done any good; it was\\nnot the storm that clears the sky--all storms do not clear the sky. And\\nMrs. Taylor looked at the pale girl and saw that she could do nothing to\\nhelp her toward peace of mind.\\n\\n“Of course,” she said to her husband, after returning from her\\nprofitless errand, “you might know she'd feel dreadful.\\n\\n“What about?” said Taylor.\\n\\n“Why, you know just as well as I do. And I'll say for myself, I hope\\nyou'll never have to help hang folks.”\\n\\n“Well,” said Taylor, mildly, “if I had to, I'd have to, I guess.”\\n\\n“Well, I don't want it to come. But that poor girl is eating her heart\\nright out over it.”\\n\\n“What does she say?”\\n\\n“It's what she don't say. She'll not talk, and she'll not let me talk,\\nand she sits and sits.”\\n\\n“I'll go talk some to her,” said the man.\\n\\n“Well, Taylor, I thought you had more sense. You'd not get a word in.\\nShe'll be sick soon if her worry ain't stopped someway, though.”\\n\\n“What does she want this country to do?” inquired Taylor. “Does she\\nexpect it to be like Vermont when it--”\\n\\n“We can't help what she expects,” his wife interrupted. “But I wish we\\ncould help HER.”\\n\\nThey could not, however; and help came from another source. Judge Henry\\nrode by the next day. To him good Mrs. Taylor at once confided her\\nanxiety. The Judge looked grave.\\n\\n“Must I meddle?” he said.\\n\\n“Yes, Judge, you must,” said Mrs. Taylor.\\n\\n“But why can't I send him over here when he gets back? Then they'll just\\nsettle it between themselves.”\\n\\nMrs. Taylor shook her head. “That would unsettle it worse than it is,”\\n she assured him. “They mustn't meet just now.”\\n\\nThe Judge sighed. “Well,” he said, “very well. I'll sacrifice my\\ncharacter, since you insist.”\\n\\nJudge Henry sat thinking, waiting until school should be out. He did not\\nat all relish what lay before him. He would like to have got out of it.\\nHe had been a federal judge; he had been an upright judge; he had met\\nthe responsibilities of his difficult office not only with learning,\\nwhich is desirable, but also with courage and common sense besides, and\\nthese are essential. He had been a stanch servant of the law. And now\\nhe was invited to defend that which, at first sight, nay, even at second\\nand third sight, must always seem a defiance of the law more injurious\\nthan crime itself. Every good man in this world has convictions about\\nright and wrong. They are his soul's riches, his spiritual gold. When\\nhis conduct is at variance with these, he knows that it is a departure,\\na falling; and this is a simple and clear matter. If falling were all\\nthat ever happened to a good man, all his days would be a simple matter\\nof striving and repentance. But it is not all. There come to him certain\\njunctures, crises, when life, like a highwayman, springs upon him,\\ndemanding that he stand and deliver his convictions in the name of some\\nrighteous cause, bidding him do evil that good may come. I cannot say\\nthat I believe in doing evil that good may come. I do not. I think that\\nany man who honestly justifies such course deceives himself. But this I\\ncan say: to call any act evil, instantly begs the question. Many an act\\nthat man does is right or wrong according to the time and place\\nwhich form, so to speak, its context; strip it of its surrounding\\ncircumstances, and you tear away its meaning. Gentlemen reformers,\\nbeware of this common practice of yours! beware of calling an act evil\\non Tuesday because that same act was evil on Monday!\\n\\nDo you fail to follow my meaning? Then here is an illustration. On\\nMonday I walk over my neighbor's field; there is no wrong in such\\nwalking. By Tuesday he has put up a sign that trespassers will\\nbe prosecuted according to law. I walk again on Tuesday, and am a\\nlaw-breaker. Do you begin to see my point? or are you inclined to object\\nto the illustration because the walking on Tuesday was not WRONG, but\\nmerely ILLEGAL? Then here is another illustration which you will find\\nit a trifle more embarrassing to answer. Consider carefully, let me beg\\nyou, the case of a young man and a young woman who walk out of a door\\non Tuesday, pronounced man and wife by a third party inside the door.\\nIt matters not that on Monday they were, in their own hearts, sacredly\\nvowed to each other. If they had omitted stepping inside that door,\\nif they had dispensed with that third party, and gone away on Monday\\nsacredly vowed to each other in their own hearts, you would\\nhave scarcely found their conduct moral. Consider these things\\ncarefully,--the sign-post and the third party,--and the difference they\\nmake. And now, for a finish, we will return to the sign-post.\\n\\nSuppose that I went over my neighbor's field on Tuesday, after the\\nsign-post was put up, because I saw a murder about to be committed in\\nthe field, and therefore ran in and stopped it. Was I doing evil that\\ngood might come? Do you not think that to stay out and let the murder be\\ndone would have been the evil act in this case? To disobey the sign-post\\nwas RIGHT; and I trust that you now perceive the same act may wear as\\nmany different hues of right or wrong as the rainbow, according to the\\natmosphere in which it is done. It is not safe to say of any man, “He\\ndid evil that good might come.” Was the thing that he did, in the first\\nplace, evil? That is the question.\\n\\nForgive my asking you to use your mind. It is a thing which no novelist\\nshould expect of his reader, and we will go back at once to Judge Henry\\nand his meditations about lynching.\\n\\nHe was well aware that if he was to touch at all upon this subject with\\nthe New England girl, he could not put her off with mere platitudes and\\nhumdrum formulas; not, at least, if he expected to do any good. She was\\nfar too intelligent, and he was really anxious to do good. For her sake\\nhe wanted the course of the girl's true love to run more smoothly, and\\nstill more did he desire this for the sake of his Virginian.\\n\\n“I sent him myself on that business,” the Judge reflected uncomfortably.\\n“I am partly responsible for the lynching. It has brought him one great\\nunhappiness already through the death of Steve. If it gets running\\nin this girl's mind, she may--dear me!” the Judge broke off, “what a\\nnuisance!” And he sighed. For as all men know, he also knew that many\\nthings should be done in this world in silence, and that talking about\\nthem is a mistake.\\n\\nBut when school was out, and the girl gone to her cabin, his mind had\\nset the subject in order thoroughly, and he knocked at her door, ready,\\nas he had put it, to sacrifice his character in the cause of true love.\\n\\n“Well,” he said, coming straight to the point, “some dark things have\\nhappened.” And when she made no answer to this, he continued: “But you\\nmust not misunderstand us. We're too fond of you for that.”\\n\\n“Judge Henry,” said Molly Wood, also coming straight to the point, “have\\nyou come to tell me that you think well of lynching?”\\n\\nHe met her. “Of burning Southern negroes in public, no. Of hanging\\nWyoming cattle thieves in private, yes. You perceive there's a\\ndifference, don't you?”\\n\\n“Not in principle,” said the girl, dry and short.\\n\\n“Oh--dear--me!” slowly exclaimed the Judge. “I am sorry that you cannot\\nsee that, because I think that I can. And I think that you have just\\nas much sense as I have.” The Judge made himself very grave and very\\ngood-humored at the same time. The poor girl was strung to a high pitch,\\nand spoke harshly in spite of herself.\\n\\n“What is the difference in principle?” she demanded.\\n\\n“Well,” said the Judge, easy and thoughtful, “what do you mean by\\nprinciple?”\\n\\n“I didn't think you'd quibble,” flashed Molly. “I'm not a lawyer\\nmyself.”\\n\\nA man less wise than Judge Henry would have smiled at this, and then war\\nwould have exploded hopelessly between them, and harm been added to what\\nwas going wrong already. But the Judge knew that he must give to every\\nword that the girl said now his perfect consideration.\\n\\n“I don't mean to quibble,” he assured her. “I know the trick of escaping\\nfrom one question by asking another. But I don't want to escape from\\nanything you hold me to answer. If you can show me that I am wrong, I\\nwant you to do so. But,” and here the Judge smiled, “I want you to play\\nfair, too.”\\n\\n“And how am I not?”\\n\\n“I want you to be just as willing to be put right by me as I am to be\\nput right by you. And so when you use such a word as principle, you\\nmust help me to answer by saying what principle you mean. For in all\\nsincerity I see no likeness in principle whatever between burning\\nSouthern negroes in public and hanging Wyoming horse-thieves in private.\\nI consider the burning a proof that the South is semi-barbarous, and the\\nhanging a proof that Wyoming is determined to become civilized. We\\ndo not torture our criminals when we lynch them. We do not invite\\nspectators to enjoy their death agony. We put no such hideous disgrace\\nupon the United States. We execute our criminals by the swiftest means,\\nand in the quietest way. Do you think the principle is the same?”\\n\\nMolly had listened to him with attention. “The way is different,” she\\nadmitted.\\n\\n“Only the way?”\\n\\n“So it seems to me. Both defy law and order.”\\n\\n“Ah, but do they both? Now we're getting near the principle.”\\n\\n“Why, yes. Ordinary citizens take the law in their own hands.”\\n\\n“The principle at last!” exclaimed the Judge.\\n\\n“Now tell me some more things. Out of whose hands do they take the law?”\\n\\n“The court's.”\\n\\n“What made the courts?”\\n\\n“I don't understand.”\\n\\n“How did there come to be any courts?”\\n\\n“The Constitution.”\\n\\n“How did there come to be any Constitution? Who made it?”\\n\\n“The delegates, I suppose.”\\n\\n“Who made the delegates?”\\n\\n“I suppose they were elected, or appointed, or something.”\\n\\n“And who elected them?”\\n\\n“Of course the people elected them.”\\n\\n“Call them the ordinary citizens,” said the Judge. “I like your term.\\nThey are where the law comes from, you see. For they chose the delegates\\nwho made the Constitution that provided for the courts. There's your\\nmachinery. These are the hands into which ordinary citizens have put the\\nlaw. So you see, at best, when they lynch they only take back what they\\nonce gave. Now we'll take your two cases that you say are the same in\\nprinciple. I think that they are not. For in the South they take a negro\\nfrom jail where he was waiting to be duly hung. The South has never\\nclaimed that the law would let him go. But in Wyoming the law has been\\nletting our cattle-thieves go for two years. We are in a very bad way,\\nand we are trying to make that way a little better until civilization\\ncan reach us. At present we lie beyond its pale. The courts, or rather\\nthe juries, into whose hands we have put the law, are not dealing the\\nlaw. They are withered hands, or rather they are imitation hands\\nmade for show, with no life in them, no grip. They cannot hold a\\ncattle-thief. And so when your ordinary citizen sees this, and sees that\\nhe has placed justice in a dead hand, he must take justice back into his\\nown hands where it was once at the beginning of all things. Call this\\nprimitive, if you will. But so far from being a DEFIANCE of the law, it\\nis an ASSERTION of it--the fundamental assertion of self governing men,\\nupon whom our whole social fabric is based. There is your principle,\\nMiss Wood, as I see it. Now can you help me to see anything different?”\\n\\nShe could not.\\n\\n“But perhaps you are of the same opinion still?” the Judge inquired.\\n\\n“It is all terrible to me,” she said.\\n\\n“Yes; and so is capital punishment terrible. And so is war. And perhaps\\nsome day we shall do without them. But they are none of them so terrible\\nas unchecked theft and murder would be.”\\n\\nAfter the Judge had departed on his way to Sunk Creek, no one spoke to\\nMolly upon this subject. But her face did not grow cheerful at once. It\\nwas plain from her fits of silence that her thoughts were not at rest.\\nAnd sometimes at night she would stand in front of her lover's likeness,\\ngazing upon it with both love and shrinking.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXXIV. TO FIT HER FINGER\\n\\n\\nIt was two rings that the Virginian wrote for when next I heard from\\nhim.\\n\\nAfter my dark sight of what the Cattle Land could be, I soon had\\njourneyed home by way of Washakie and Rawlins. Steve and Shorty did not\\nleave my memory, nor will they ever, I suppose.\\n\\nThe Virginian had touched the whole thing the day I left him. He had\\nnoticed me looking a sort of farewell at the plains and mountains.\\n\\n“You will come back to it,” he said. “If there was a headstone for every\\nman that once pleasured in his freedom here, yu'd see one most every\\ntime yu' turned your head. It's a heap sadder than a graveyard--but yu'\\nlove it all the same.”\\n\\nSadness had passed from him--from his uppermost mood, at least, when\\nhe wrote about the rings. Deep in him was sadness of course, as well as\\njoy. For he had known Steve, and he had covered Shorty with earth. He\\nhad looked upon life with a marksman's eyes, very close; and no one,\\nif he have a heart, can pass through this and not carry sadness in his\\nspirit with him forever. But he seldom shows it openly; it bides within\\nhim, enriching his cheerfulness and rendering him of better service to\\nhis fellow-men.\\n\\nIt was a commission of cheerfulness that he now gave, being distant\\nfrom where rings are to be bought. He could not go so far as the East\\nto procure what he had planned. Rings were to be had in Cheyenne, and a\\nstill greater choice in Denver; and so far as either of these towns his\\naffairs would have permitted him to travel. But he was set upon having\\nrings from the East. They must come from the best place in the country;\\nnothing short of that was good enough “to fit her finger,” as he said.\\nThe wedding ring was a simple matter. Let it be right, that was all:\\nthe purest gold that could be used, with her initials and his together\\ngraven round the inside, with the day of the month and the year.\\n\\nThe date was now set. It had come so far as this. July third was to be\\nthe day. Then for sixty days and nights he was to be a bridegroom, free\\nfrom his duties at Sunk Creek, free to take his bride wheresoever she\\nmight choose to go. And she had chosen.\\n\\nThose voices of the world had more than angered her; for after the anger\\na set purpose was left. Her sister should have the chance neither to\\ncome nor to stay away. Had her mother even answered the Virginian's\\nletter, there could have been some relenting. But the poor lady had been\\ninadequate in this, as in all other searching moments of her life: she\\nhad sent messages,--kind ones, to be sure,--but only messages. If this\\nhad hurt the Virginian, no one knew it in the world, least of all the\\ngirl in whose heart it had left a cold, frozen spot. Not a good spirit\\nin which to be married, you will say. No; frozen spots are not good at\\nany time. But Molly's own nature gave her due punishment. Through all\\nthese days of her warm happiness a chill current ran, like those which\\ninterrupt the swimmer's perfect joy. The girl was only half as happy\\nas her lover; but she hid this deep from him,--hid it until that final,\\nfierce hour of reckoning that her nature had with her,--nay, was bound\\nto have with her, before the punishment was lifted, and the frozen spot\\nmelted at length from her heart.\\n\\nSo, meanwhile, she made her decree against Bennington. Not Vermont,\\nbut Wyoming, should be her wedding place. No world's voices should be\\nwhispering, no world's eyes should be looking on, when she made her vow\\nto him and received his vow. Those voices should be spoken and that ring\\nput on in this wild Cattle Land, where first she had seen him ride into\\nthe flooded river, and lift her ashore upon his horse. It was this open\\nsky which should shine down on them, and this frontier soil upon which\\ntheir feet should tread. The world should take its turn second.\\n\\nAfter a month with him by stream and canyon, a month far deeper into the\\nmountain wilds than ever yet he had been free to take her, a month with\\nsometimes a tent and sometimes the stars above them, and only their\\nhorses besides themselves--after such a month as this, she would take\\nhim to her mother and to Bennington; and the old aunt over at Dunbarton\\nwould look at him, and be once more able to declare that the Starks had\\nalways preferred a man who was a man.\\n\\nAnd so July third was to be engraved inside the wedding ring. Upon the\\nother ring the Virginian had spent much delicious meditation, all in his\\nsecret mind. He had even got the right measure of her finger without her\\nsuspecting the reason. But this step was the final one in his plan.\\n\\nDuring the time that his thoughts had begun to be busy over the other\\nring, by a chance he had learned from Mrs. Henry a number of old fancies\\nregarding precious stones. Mrs. Henry often accompanied the Judge in\\nventuresome mountain climbs, and sometimes the steepness of the rocks\\nrequired her to use her hands for safety. One day when the Virginian\\nwent with them to help mark out certain boundary corners, she removed\\nher rings lest they should get scratched; and he, being just behind her,\\ntook them during the climb.\\n\\n“I see you're looking at my topaz,” she had said, as he returned them.\\n“If I could have chosen, it would have been a ruby. But I was born in\\nNovember.”\\n\\nHe did not understand her in the least, but her words awakened exceeding\\ninterest in him; and they had descended some five miles of mountain\\nbefore he spoke again. Then he became ingenious, for he had half worked\\nout what Mrs. Henry's meaning must be; but he must make quite sure.\\nTherefore, according to his wild, shy nature, he became ingenious.\\n\\n“Men wear rings,” he began. “Some of the men on the ranch do. I don't\\nsee any harm in a man's wearin' a ring. But I never have.”\\n\\n“Well,” said the lady, not yet suspecting that he was undertaking to\\ncircumvent her, “probably those men have sweethearts.”\\n\\n“No, ma'am. Not sweethearts worth wearin' rings for--in two cases,\\nanyway. They won 'em at cyards. And they like to see 'em shine. I never\\nsaw a man wear a topaz.”\\n\\nMrs. Henry did not have any further remark to make.\\n\\n“I was born in January myself,” pursued the Virginian, very\\nthoughtfully.\\n\\nThen the lady gave him one look, and without further process of mind\\nperceived exactly what he was driving at.\\n\\n“That's very extravagant for rings,” said she. “January is diamonds.”\\n\\n“Diamonds,” murmured the Virginian, more and more thoughtfully. “Well,\\nit don't matter, for I'd not wear a ring. And November is--what did yu'\\nsay, ma'am?”\\n\\n“Topaz.”\\n\\n“Yes. Well, jewels are cert'nly pretty things. In the Spanish Missions\\nyu'll see large ones now and again. And they're not glass, I think. And\\nso they have got some jewel that kind of belongs to each month right\\naround the twelve?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Mrs. Henry, smiling. “One for each month. But the opal is\\nwhat you want.”\\n\\nHe looked at her, and began to blush.\\n\\n“October is the opal,” she added, and she laughed outright, for Miss\\nWood's birthday was on the fifteenth of that month.\\n\\nThe Virginian smiled guiltily at her through his crimson.\\n\\n“I've no doubt you can beat around the bush very well with men,” said\\nMrs. Henry. “But it's perfectly transparent with us--in matters of\\nsentiment, at least.”\\n\\n“Well, I am sorry,” he presently said. “I don't want to give her an\\nopal. I have no superstition, but I don't want to give her an opal. If\\nher mother did, or anybody like that, why, all right. But not from me.\\nD' yu' understand, ma'am?”\\n\\nMrs. Henry did understand this subtle trait in the wild man, and she\\nrejoiced to be able to give him immediate reassurance concerning opals.\\n\\n“Don't worry about that,” she said. “The opal is said to bring ill luck,\\nbut not when it is your own month stone. Then it is supposed to be not\\nonly deprived of evil influence, but to possess peculiarly fortunate\\npower. Let it be an opal ring.”\\n\\nThen he asked her boldly various questions, and she showed him her\\nrings, and gave him advice about the setting. There was no special\\ncustom, she told him, ruling such rings as this he desired to bestow.\\nThe gem might be the lady's favorite or the lover's favorite; and to\\nchoose the lady's month stone was very well indeed.\\n\\nVery well indeed, the Virginian thought. But not quite well enough for\\nhim. His mind now busied itself with this lore concerning jewels, and\\nsoon his sentiment had suggested something which he forthwith carried\\nout.\\n\\nWhen the ring was achieved, it was an opal, but set with four small\\nembracing diamonds. Thus was her month stone joined with his, that their\\nluck and their love might be inseparably clasped.\\n\\nHe found the size of her finger one day when winter had departed, and\\nthe early grass was green. He made a ring of twisted grass for her,\\nwhile she held her hand for him to bind it. He made another for himself.\\nThen, after each had worn their grass ring for a while, he begged her\\nto exchange. He did not send his token away from him, but most carefully\\nmeasured it. Thus the ring fitted her well, and the lustrous flame\\nwithin the opal thrilled his heart each time he saw it. For now June was\\nnear its end; and that other plain gold ring, which, for safe keeping,\\nhe cherished suspended round his neck day and night, seemed to burn with\\nan inward glow that was deeper than the opal's.\\n\\nSo in due course arrived the second of July. Molly's punishment had got\\nas far as this: she longed for her mother to be near her at this time;\\nbut it was too late.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXXV. WITH MALICE AFORETHOUGHT\\n\\n\\nTown lay twelve straight miles before the lover and his sweetheart, when\\nthey came to the brow of the last long hill. All beneath them was like\\na map: neither man nor beast distinguishable, but the veined and tinted\\nimage of a country, knobs and flats set out in order clearly, shining\\nextensive and motionless in the sun. It opened on the sight of the\\nlovers as they reached the sudden edge of the tableland, where since\\nmorning they had ridden with the head of neither horse ever in advance\\nof the other.\\n\\nAt the view of their journey's end, the Virginian looked down at his\\ngirl beside him, his eyes filled with a bridegroom's light, and, hanging\\nsafe upon his breast, he could feel the gold ring that he would slowly\\npress upon her finger to-morrow. He drew off the glove from her left\\nhand, and stooping, kissed the jewel in that other ring which he had\\ngiven her. The crimson fire in the opal seemed to mingle with that in\\nhis heart, and his arm lifted her during a moment from the saddle as he\\nheld her to him. But in her heart the love of him was troubled by that\\ncold pang of loneliness which had crept upon her like a tide as the day\\ndrew near. None of her own people were waiting in that distant town to\\nsee her become his bride. Friendly faces she might pass on the way; but\\nall of them new friends, made in this wild country: not a face of her\\nchildhood would smile upon her; and deep within her, a voice cried for\\nthe mother who was far away in Vermont. That she would see Mrs. Taylor's\\nkind face at her wedding was no comfort now.\\n\\nThere lay the town in the splendor of Wyoming space. Around it spread\\nthe watered fields, westward for a little way, eastward to a great\\ndistance, making squares of green and yellow crops; and the town was but\\na poor rag in the midst of this quilted harvest. After the fields to the\\neast, the tawny plain began; and with one faint furrow of river lining\\nits undulations, it stretched beyond sight. But west of the town rose\\nthe Bow Leg Mountains, cool with their still unmelted snows and their\\ndull blue gulfs of pine. From three canyons flowed three clear forks\\nwhich began the river. Their confluence was above the town a good two\\nmiles; it looked but a few paces from up here, while each side the river\\nstraggled the margin cottonwoods, like thin borders along a garden walk.\\nOver all this map hung silence like a harmony, tremendous yet serene.\\n\\n“How beautiful! how I love it!” whispered the girl. “But, oh, how big it\\nis!” And she leaned against her lover for an instant. It was her spirit\\nseeking shelter. To-day, this vast beauty, this primal calm, had in it\\nfor her something almost of dread. The small, comfortable, green hills\\nof home rose before her. She closed her eyes and saw Vermont: a village\\nstreet, and the post-office, and ivy covering an old front door, and her\\nmother picking some yellow roses from a bush.\\n\\nAt a sound, her eyes quickly opened; and here was her lover turned in\\nhis saddle, watching another horseman approach. She saw the Virginian's\\nhand in a certain position, and knew that his pistol was ready. But the\\nother merely overtook and passed them, as they stood at the brow of the\\nhill.\\n\\nThe man had given one nod to the Virginian, and the Virginian one to\\nhim; and now he was already below them on the descending road. To Molly\\nWood he was a stranger; but she had seen his eyes when he nodded to her\\nlover, and she knew, even without the pistol, that this was not enmity\\nat first sight. It was not indeed. Five years of gathered hate had\\nlooked out of the man's eyes. And she asked her lover who this was.\\n\\n“Oh,” said he, easily, “just a man I see now and then.”\\n\\n“Is his name Trampas?” said Molly Wood.\\n\\nThe Virginian looked at her in surprise. “Why, where have you seen him?”\\n he asked.\\n\\n“Never till now. But I knew.”\\n\\n“My gracious! Yu' never told me yu' had mind-reading powers.” And he\\nsmiled serenely at her.\\n\\n“I knew it was Trampas as soon as I saw his eyes.”\\n\\n“My gracious!” her lover repeated with indulgent irony. “I must be\\nmighty careful of my eyes when you're lookin' at 'em.”\\n\\n“I believe he did that murder,” said the girl.\\n\\n“Whose mind are yu' readin' now?” he drawled affectionately.\\n\\nBut he could not joke her off the subject. She took his strong hand in\\nhers, tremulously, so much of it as her little hand could hold. “I know\\nsomething about that--that--last autumn,” she said, shrinking from words\\nmore definite. “And I know that you only did--”\\n\\n“What I had to,” he finished, very sadly, but sternly, too.\\n\\n“Yes,” she asserted, keeping hold of his hand. “I suppose\\nthat--lynching--” (she almost whispered the word) “is the only way. But\\nwhen they had to die just for stealing horses, it seems so wicked that\\nthis murderer--”\\n\\n“Who can prove it?” asked the Virginian.\\n\\n“But don't you know it?”\\n\\n“I know a heap o' things inside my heart. But that's not proving. There\\nwas only the body, and the hoofprints--and what folks guessed.”\\n\\n“He was never even arrested!” the girl said.\\n\\n“No. He helped elect the sheriff in that county.”\\n\\nThen Molly ventured a step inside the border of her lover's reticence.\\n“I saw--” she hesitated, “just now, I saw what you did.”\\n\\nHe returned to his caressing irony. “You'll have me plumb scared if you\\nkeep on seein' things.”\\n\\n“You had your pistol ready for him.”\\n\\n“Why, I believe I did. It was mighty unnecessary.” And the Virginian\\ntook out the pistol again, and shook his head over it, like one who has\\nbeen caught in a blunder.\\n\\nShe looked at him, and knew that she must step outside his reticence\\nagain. By love and her surrender to him their positions had been\\nexchanged.\\n\\nHe was not now, as through his long courting he had been, her\\nhalf-obeying, half-refractory worshipper. She was no longer his\\nhalf-indulgent, half-scornful superior. Her better birth and schooling\\nthat had once been weapons to keep him at his distance, or bring her off\\nvictorious in their encounters, had given way before the onset of\\nthe natural man himself. She knew her cow-boy lover, with all that he\\nlacked, to be more than ever she could be, with all that she had. He was\\nher worshipper still, but her master, too. Therefore now, against the\\nbaffling smile he gave her, she felt powerless. And once again a pang of\\nyearning for her mother to be near her to-day shot through the girl. She\\nlooked from her untamed man to the untamed desert of Wyoming, and the\\ntown where she was to take him as her wedded husband. But for his sake\\nshe would not let him guess her loneliness.\\n\\nHe sat on his horse Monte, considering the pistol. Then he showed her a\\nrattlesnake coiled by the roots of some sage-brush. “Can I hit it?” he\\ninquired.\\n\\n“You don't often miss them,” said she, striving to be cheerful.\\n\\n“Well, I'm told getting married unstrings some men.” He aimed, and the\\nsnake was shattered. “Maybe it's too early yet for the unstringing to\\nbegin!” And with some deliberation he sent three more bullets into the\\nsnake. “I reckon that's enough,” said he.\\n\\n“Was not the first one?”\\n\\n“Oh, yes, for the snake.” And then, with one leg crooked cow-boy fashion\\nacross in front of his saddle-horn, he cleaned his pistol, and replaced\\nthe empty cartridges.\\n\\nOnce more she ventured near the line of his reticence. “Has--has Trampas\\nseen you much lately?”\\n\\n“Why, no; not for a right smart while. But I reckon he has not missed\\nme.”\\n\\nThe Virginian spoke this in his gentlest voice. But his rebuffed\\nsweetheart turned her face away, and from her eyes she brushed a tear.\\n\\nHe reined his horse Monte beside her, and upon her cheek she felt his\\nkiss. “You are not the only mind-reader,” said he, very tenderly. And\\nat this she clung to him, and laid her head upon his breast. “I had been\\nthinking,” he went on, “that the way our marriage is to be was the most\\nbeautiful way.”\\n\\n“It is the most beautiful,” she murmured.\\n\\nHe slowly spoke out his thought, as if she had not said this. “No folks\\nto stare, no fuss, no jokes and ribbons and best bonnets, no public\\neye nor talkin' of tongues when most yu' want to hear nothing and say\\nnothing.”\\n\\nShe answered by holding him closer.\\n\\n“Just the bishop of Wyoming to join us, and not even him after we're\\nonce joined. I did think that would be ahead of all ways to get married\\nI have seen.”\\n\\nHe paused again, and she made no rejoinder.\\n\\n“But we have left out your mother.”\\n\\nShe looked in his face with quick astonishment. It was as if his spirit\\nhad heard the cry of her spirit.\\n\\n“That is nowhere near right,” he said. “That is wrong.”\\n\\n“She could never have come here,” said the girl.\\n\\n“We should have gone there. I don't know how I can ask her to forgive\\nme.”\\n\\n“But it was not you!” cried Molly.\\n\\n“Yes. Because I did not object. I did not tell you we must go to her.\\nI missed the point, thinking so much about my own feelings. For you\\nsee--and I've never said this to you until now--your mother did hurt me.\\nWhen you said you would have me after my years of waiting, and I wrote\\nher that letter telling her all about myself, and how my family was not\\nlike yours, and--and--all the rest I told her, why you see it hurt me\\nnever to get a word back from her except just messages through you. For\\nI had talked to her about my hopes and my failings. I had said more\\nthan ever I've said to you, because she was your mother. I wanted her to\\nforgive me, if she could, and feel that maybe I could take good care of\\nyou after all. For it was bad enough to have her daughter quit her home\\nto teach school out hyeh on Bear Creek. Bad enough without havin' me to\\ncome along and make it worse. I have missed the point in thinking of my\\nown feelings.”\\n\\n“But it's not your doing!” repeated Molly.\\n\\nWith his deep delicacy he had put the whole matter as a hardship to her\\nmother alone. He had saved her any pain of confession or denial. “Yes,\\nit is my doing,” he now said. “Shall we give it up?”\\n\\n“Give what--?” She did not understand.\\n\\n“Why, the order we've got it fixed in. Plans are--well, they're no\\nmore than plans. I hate the notion of changing, but I hate hurting your\\nmother more. Or, anyway, I OUGHT to hate it more. So we can shift, if\\nyu' say so. It's not too late.”\\n\\n“Shift?” she faltered.\\n\\n“I mean, we can go to your home now. We can start by the stage to-night.\\nYour mother can see us married. We can come back and finish in the\\nmountains instead of beginning in them. It'll be just merely shifting,\\nyu' see.”\\n\\nHe could scarcely bring himself to say this at all; yet he said it\\nalmost as if he were urging it. It implied a renunciation that he could\\nhardly bear to think of. To put off his wedding day, the bliss upon\\nwhose threshold he stood after his three years of faithful battle\\nfor it, and that wedding journey he had arranged: for there were the\\nmountains in sight, the woods and canyons where he had planned to go\\nwith her after the bishop had joined them; the solitudes where only the\\nwild animals would be, besides themselves. His horses, his tent, his\\nrifle, his rod, all were waiting ready in the town for their start\\nto-morrow. He had provided many dainty things to make her comfortable.\\nWell, he could wait a little more, having waited three years. It would\\nnot be what his heart most desired: there would be the “public eye and\\nthe talking of tongues”--but he could wait. The hour would come when he\\ncould be alone with his bride at last. And so he spoke as if he urged\\nit.\\n\\n“Never!” she cried. “Never, never!”\\n\\nShe pushed it from her. She would not brook such sacrifice on his part.\\nWere they not going to her mother in four weeks? If her family had\\nwarmly accepted him--but they had not; and in any case, it had gone too\\nfar, it was too late. She told her lover that she would not hear him,\\nthat if he said any more she would gallop into town separately from him.\\nAnd for his sake she would hide deep from him this loneliness of hers,\\nand the hurt that he had given her in refusing to share with her his\\ntrouble with Trampas, when others must know of it.\\n\\nAccordingly, they descended the hill slowly together, lingering to spin\\nout these last miles long. Many rides had taught their horses to go\\nside by side, and so they went now: the girl sweet and thoughtful in her\\nsedate gray habit; and the man in his leathern chaps and cartridge belt\\nand flannel shirt, looking gravely into the distance with the level gaze\\nof the frontier.\\n\\nHaving read his sweetheart's mind very plainly, the lover now broke his\\ndearest custom. It was his code never to speak ill of any man to any\\nwoman. Men's quarrels were not for women's ears. In his scheme, good\\nwomen were to know only a fragment of men's lives. He had lived many\\noutlaw years, and his wide knowledge of evil made innocence doubly\\nprecious to him. But to-day he must depart from his code, having read\\nher mind well. He would speak evil of one man to one woman, because his\\nreticence had hurt her--and was she not far from her mother, and very\\nlonely, do what he could? She should know the story of his quarrel in\\nlanguage as light and casual as he could veil it with.\\n\\nHe made an oblique start. He did not say to her: “I'll tell you about\\nthis. You saw me get ready for Trampas because I have been ready for him\\nany time these five years.” He began far off from the point with that\\nrooted caution of his--that caution which is shared by the primal savage\\nand the perfected diplomat.\\n\\n“There's cert'nly a right smart o' difference between men and women,” he\\nobserved.\\n\\n“You're quite sure?” she retorted.\\n\\n“Ain't it fortunate?--that there's both, I mean.”\\n\\n“I don't know about fortunate. Machinery could probably do all the heavy\\nwork for us without your help.”\\n\\n“And who'd invent the machinery?”\\n\\nShe laughed. “We shouldn't need the huge, noisy things you do. Our world\\nwould be a gentle one.”\\n\\n“Oh, my gracious!”\\n\\n“What do you mean by that?”\\n\\n“Oh, my gracious! Get along, Monte! A gentle world all full of ladies!”\\n\\n“Do you call men gentle?” inquired Molly.\\n\\n“Now it's a funny thing about that. Have yu' ever noticed a joke about\\nfathers-in-law? There's just as many fathers--as mothers-in-law; but\\nwhich side are your jokes?”\\n\\nMolly was not vanquished. “That's because the men write the comic\\npapers,” said she.\\n\\n“Hear that, Monte? The men write 'em. Well, if the ladies wrote a comic\\npaper, I expect that might be gentle.”\\n\\nShe gave up this battle in mirth; and he resumed:-- “But don't you\\nreally reckon it's uncommon to meet a father-in-law flouncin' around\\nthe house? As for gentle--Once I had to sleep in a room next a ladies'\\ntemperance meetin'. Oh, heavens! Well, I couldn't change my room, and\\nthe hotel man, he apologized to me next mawnin'. Said it didn't surprise\\nhim the husbands drank some.”\\n\\nHere the Virginian broke down over his own fantastic inventions, and\\ngave a joyous chuckle in company with his sweetheart. “Yes, there's\\na big heap o' difference between men and women,” he said. “Take that\\nfello' and myself, now.”\\n\\n“Trampas?” said Molly, quickly serious. She looked along the road ahead,\\nand discerned the figure of Trampas still visible on its way to town.\\n\\nThe Virginian did not wish her to be serious--more than could be helped.\\n“Why, yes,” he replied, with a waving gesture at Trampas. “Take him and\\nme. He don't think much o' me! How could he? And I expect he'll never.\\nBut yu' saw just now how it was between us. We were not a bit like a\\ntemperance meetin'.”\\n\\nShe could not help laughing at the twist he gave to his voice. And she\\nfelt happiness warming her; for in the Virginian's tone about Trampas\\nwas something now that no longer excluded her. Thus he began his gradual\\nrecital, in a cadence always easy, and more and more musical with the\\nnative accent of the South. With the light turn he gave it, its pure\\nugliness melted into charm.\\n\\n“No, he don't think anything of me. Once a man in the John Day Valley\\ndidn't think much, and by Canada de Oro I met another. It will always be\\nso here and there, but Trampas beats 'em all. For the others have always\\nexpressed themselves--got shut of their poor opinion in the open air.”\\n\\n“Yu' see, I had to explain myself to Trampas a right smart while ago,\\nlong before ever I laid my eyes on yu'. It was just nothing at all. A\\nlittle matter of cyards in the days when I was apt to spend my money and\\nmy holidays pretty headlong. My gracious, what nonsensical times I have\\nhad! But I was apt to win at cyards, 'specially poker. And Trampas, he\\nmet me one night, and I expect he must have thought I looked kind o'\\nyoung. So he hated losin' his money to such a young-lookin' man, and he\\ntook his way of sayin' as much. I had to explain myself to him plainly,\\nso that he learned right away my age had got its growth.\\n\\n“Well, I expect he hated that worse, having to receive my explanation\\nwith folks lookin' on at us publicly that-a-way, and him without further\\nideas occurrin' to him at the moment. That's what started his poor\\nopinion of me, not havin' ideas at the moment. And so the boys resumed\\ntheir cyards.\\n\\n“I'd most forgot about it. But Trampas's mem'ry is one of his strong\\npoints. Next thing--oh, it's a good while later--he gets to losin' flesh\\nbecause Judge Henry gave me charge of him and some other punchers taking\\ncattle--”\\n\\n“That's not next,” interrupted the girl.\\n\\n“Not? Why--”\\n\\n“Don't you remember?” she said, timid, yet eager. “Don't you?”\\n\\n“Blamed if I do!”\\n\\n“The first time we met?”\\n\\n“Yes; my mem'ry keeps that--like I keep this.” And he brought from his\\npocket her own handkerchief, the token he had picked up at a river's\\nbrink when he had carried her from an overturned stage.\\n\\n“We did not exactly meet, then,” she said. “It was at that dance. I\\nhadn't seen you yet; but Trampas was saying something horrid about me,\\nand you said--you said, 'Rise on your legs, you pole cat, and tell them\\nyou're a liar.' When I heard that, I think--I think it finished me.” And\\ncrimson suffused Molly's countenance.\\n\\n“I'd forgot,” the Virginian murmured. Then sharply, “How did you hear\\nit?”\\n\\n“Mrs. Taylor--”\\n\\n“Oh! Well, a man would never have told a woman that.”\\n\\nMolly laughed triumphantly. “Then who told Mrs. Taylor?”\\n\\nBeing caught, he grinned at her. “I reckon husbands are a special kind\\nof man,” was all that he found to say. “Well, since you do know about\\nthat, it was the next move in the game. Trampas thought I had no call\\nto stop him sayin' what he pleased about a woman who was nothin' to\\nme--then. But all women ought to be somethin' to a man. So I had to give\\nTrampas another explanation in the presence of folks lookin' on, and it\\nwas just like the cyards. No ideas occurred to him again. And down goes\\nhis opinion of me some more!\\n\\n“Well, I have not been able to raise it. There has been this and that\\nand the other,--yu' know most of the later doings yourself,--and to-day\\nis the first time I've happened to see the man since the doings last\\nautumn. Yu' seem to know about them, too. He knows I can't prove he\\nwas with that gang of horse thieves. And I can't prove he killed poor\\nShorty. But he knows I missed him awful close, and spoiled his thieving\\nfor a while. So d' yu' wonder he don't think much of me? But if I had\\nlived to be twenty-nine years old like I am, and with all my chances\\nmade no enemy, I'd feel myself a failure.”\\n\\nHis story was finished. He had made her his confidant in matters he had\\nnever spoken of before, and she was happy to be thus much nearer to him.\\nIt diminished a certain fear that was mingled with her love of him.\\n\\nDuring the next several miles he was silent, and his silence was enough\\nfor her. Vermont sank away from her thoughts, and Wyoming held less of\\nloneliness. They descended altogether into the map which had stretched\\nbelow them, so that it was a map no longer, but earth with growing\\nthings, and prairie-dogs sitting upon it, and now and then a bird flying\\nover it. And after a while she said to him, “What are you thinking\\nabout?”\\n\\n“I have been doing sums. Figured in hours it sounds right short. Figured\\nin minutes it boils up into quite a mess. Twenty by sixty is twelve\\nhundred. Put that into seconds, and yu' get seventy-two thousand\\nseconds. Seventy-two thousand. Seventy-two thousand seconds yet before\\nwe get married.”\\n\\n“Seconds! To think of its having come to seconds!”\\n\\n“I am thinkin' about it. I'm choppin' sixty of 'em off every minute.”\\n\\nWith such chopping time wears away. More miles of the road lay behind\\nthem, and in the virgin wilderness the scars of new-scraped water\\nditches began to appear, and the first wire fences. Next, they were\\npassing cabins and occasional fields, the outposts of habitation. The\\nfree road became wholly imprisoned, running between unbroken stretches\\nof barbed wire. Far off to the eastward a flowing column of dust marked\\nthe approaching stage, bringing the bishop, probably, for whose visit\\nhere they had timed their wedding. The day still brimmed with heat and\\nsunshine; but the great daily shadow was beginning to move from the feet\\nof the Bow Leg Mountains outward toward the town. Presently they began\\nto meet citizens. Some of these knew them and nodded, while some did\\nnot, and stared. Turning a corner into the town's chief street, where\\nstood the hotel, the bank, the drug store, the general store, and\\nthe seven saloons, they were hailed heartily. Here were three\\nfriends,--Honey Wiggin, Scipio Le Moyne, and Lin McLean,--all desirous\\nof drinking the Virginian's health, if his lady--would she mind? The\\nthree stood grinning, with their hats off; but behind their gayety the\\nVirginian read some other purpose.\\n\\n“We'll all be very good,” said Honey Wiggin.\\n\\n“Pretty good,” said Lin.\\n\\n“Good,” said Scipio.\\n\\n“Which is the honest man?” inquired Molly, glad to see them.\\n\\n“Not one!” said the Virginian. “My old friends scare me when I think of\\ntheir ways.”\\n\\n“It's bein' engaged scares yu',” retorted Mr. McLean. “Marriage restores\\nyour courage, I find.”\\n\\n“Well, I'll trust all of you,” said Molly. “He's going to take me to the\\nhotel, and then you can drink his health as much as you please.”\\n\\nWith a smile to them she turned to proceed, and he let his horse move\\nwith hers; but he looked at his friends. Then Scipio's bleached blue\\neyes narrowed to a slit, and he said what they had all come out on the\\nstreet to say:-- “Don't change your clothes.”\\n\\n“Oh!” protested Molly, “isn't he rather dusty and countrified?”\\n\\nBut the Virginian had taken Scipio's meaning. “DON'T CHANGE YOUR\\nCLOTHES.” Innocent Molly appreciated these words no more than the\\naverage reader who reads a masterpiece, complacently unaware that\\nits style differs from that of the morning paper. Such was Scipio's\\nintention, wishing to spare her from alarm.\\n\\nSo at the hotel she let her lover go with a kiss, and without a thought\\nof Trampas. She in her room unlocked the possessions which were there\\nwaiting for her, and changed her dress.\\n\\nWedding garments, and other civilized apparel proper for a genuine\\nfrontiersman when he comes to town, were also in the hotel, ready for\\nthe Virginian to wear. It is only the somewhat green and unseasoned\\ncow-puncher who struts before the public in spurs and deadly weapons.\\nFor many a year the Virginian had put away these childish things. He\\nmade a sober toilet for the streets. Nothing but his face and bearing\\nremained out of the common when he was in a town. But Scipio had told\\nhim not to change his clothes; therefore he went out with his pistol at\\nhis hip. Soon he had joined his three friends.\\n\\n“I'm obliged to yu',” he said. “He passed me this mawnin'.”\\n\\n“We don't know his intentions,” said Wiggin.\\n\\n“Except that he's hangin' around,” said McLean.\\n\\n“And fillin' up,” said Scipio, “which reminds me--”\\n\\nThey strolled into the saloon of a friend, where, unfortunately, sat\\nsome foolish people. But one cannot always tell how much of a fool a man\\nis, at sight.\\n\\nIt was a temperate health-drinking that they made. “Here's how,” they\\nmuttered softly to the Virginian; and “How,” he returned softly, looking\\naway from them. But they had a brief meeting of eyes, standing and\\nlounging near each other, shyly; and Scipio shook hands with the\\nbridegroom. “Some day,” he stated, tapping himself; for in his vagrant\\nheart he began to envy the man who could bring himself to marry. And he\\nnodded again, repeating, “Here's how.”\\n\\nThey stood at the bar, full of sentiment, empty of words, memory\\nand affection busy in their hearts. All of them had seen rough days\\ntogether, and they felt guilty with emotion.\\n\\n“It's hot weather,” said Wiggin.\\n\\n“Hotter on Box Elder,” said McLean. “My kid has started teething.”\\n\\nWords ran dry again. They shifted their positions, looked in their\\nglasses, read the labels on the bottles. They dropped a word now and\\nthen to the proprietor about his trade, and his ornaments.\\n\\n“Good head,” commented McLean.\\n\\n“Big old ram,” assented the proprietor. “Shot him myself on Gray Bull\\nlast fall.”\\n\\n“Sheep was thick in the Tetons last fall,” said the Virginian.\\n\\nOn the bar stood a machine into which the idle customer might drop his\\nnickel. The coin then bounced among an arrangement of pegs, descending\\nat length into one or another of various holes. You might win as much as\\nten times your stake, but this was not the most usual result; and with\\nnickels the three friends and the bridegroom now mildly sported for a\\nwhile, buying them with silver when their store ran out.\\n\\n“Was it sheep you went after in the Tetons?” inquired the proprietor,\\nknowing it was horse thieves.\\n\\n“Yes,” said the Virginian. “I'll have ten more nickels.”\\n\\n“Did you get all the sheep you wanted?” the proprietor continued.\\n\\n“Poor luck,” said the Virginian.\\n\\n“Think there's a friend of yours in town this afternoon,” said the\\nproprietor.\\n\\n“Did he mention he was my friend?”\\n\\nThe proprietor laughed. The Virginian watched another nickel click down\\namong the pegs.\\n\\nHoney Wiggin now made the bridegroom a straight offer. “We'll take this\\nthing off your hands,” said he.\\n\\n“Any or all of us,” said Lin.\\n\\nBut Scipio held his peace. His loyalty went every inch as far as theirs,\\nbut his understanding of his friend went deeper. “Don't change your\\nclothes,” was the first and the last help he would be likely to give in\\nthis matter. The rest must be as such matters must always be, between\\nman and man. To the other two friends, however, this seemed a very\\nspecial case, falling outside established precedent. Therefore they\\nventured offers of interference.\\n\\n“A man don't get married every day,” apologized McLean. “We'll just run\\nhim out of town for yu'.”\\n\\n“Save yu' the trouble,” urged Wiggin. “Say the word.”\\n\\nThe proprietor now added his voice. “It'll sober him up to spend his\\nnight out in the brush. He'll quit his talk then.”\\n\\nBut the Virginian did not say the word, or any word. He stood playing\\nwith the nickels.\\n\\n“Think of her,” muttered McLean.\\n\\n“Who else would I be thinking of?” returned the Southerner. His face had\\nbecome very sombre. “She has been raised so different!” he murmured. He\\npondered a little, while the others waited, solicitous.\\n\\nA new idea came to the proprietor. “I am acting mayor of this town,”\\n said he. “I'll put him in the calaboose and keep him till you get\\nmarried and away.”\\n\\n“Say the word,” repeated Honey Wiggin.\\n\\nScipio's eye met the proprietor's, and he shook his head about a quarter\\nof an inch. The proprietor shook his to the same amount. They understood\\neach other. It had come to that point where there was no way out, save\\nonly the ancient, eternal way between man and man. It is only the great\\nmediocrity that goes to law in these personal matters.\\n\\n“So he has talked about me some?” said the Virginian.\\n\\n“It's the whiskey,” Scipio explained.\\n\\n“I expect,” said McLean, “he'd run a mile if he was in a state to\\nappreciate his insinuations.”\\n\\n“Which we are careful not to mention to yu',” said Wiggin, “unless yu'\\ninquire for 'em.”\\n\\nSome of the fools present had drawn closer to hear this interesting\\nconversation. In gatherings of more than six there will generally be at\\nleast one fool; and this company must have numbered twenty men.\\n\\n“This country knows well enough,” said one fool, who hungered to be\\nimportant, “that you don't brand no calves that ain't your own.”\\n\\nThe saturnine Virginian looked at him. “Thank yu',” said he, gravely,\\n“for your indorsement of my character.” The fool felt flattered. The\\nVirginian turned to his friends. His hand slowly pushed his hat back,\\nand he rubbed his black head in thought.\\n\\n“Glad to see yu've got your gun with you,” continued the happy fool.\\n“You know what Trampas claims about that affair of yours in the Tetons?\\nHe claims that if everything was known about the killing of Shorty--”\\n\\n“Take one on the house,” suggested the proprietor to him, amiably. “Your\\nnews will be fresher.” And he pushed him the bottle. The fool felt less\\nimportant.\\n\\n“This talk had went the rounds before it got to us,” said Scipio, “or\\nwe'd have headed it off. He has got friends in town.”\\n\\nPerplexity knotted the Virginian's brows. This community knew that a man\\nhad implied he was a thief and a murderer; it also knew that he knew\\nit. But the case was one of peculiar circumstances, assuredly. Could he\\navoid meeting the man? Soon the stage would be starting south for the\\nrailroad. He had already to-day proposed to his sweetheart that they\\nshould take it. Could he for her sake leave unanswered a talking enemy\\nupon the field? His own ears had not heard the enemy.\\n\\nInto these reflections the fool stepped once more. “Of course this\\ncountry don't believe Trampas,” said he. “This country--”\\n\\nBut he contributed no further thoughts. From somewhere in the rear of\\nthe building, where it opened upon the tin cans and the hinder purlieus\\nof the town, came a movement, and Trampas was among them, courageous\\nwith whiskey.\\n\\nAll the fools now made themselves conspicuous. One lay on the floor,\\nknocked there by the Virginian, whose arm he had attempted to hold.\\nOthers struggled with Trampas, and his bullet smashed the ceiling\\nbefore they could drag the pistol from him. “There now! there now!” they\\ninterposed; “you don't want to talk like that,” for he was pouring out a\\ntide of hate and vilification. Yet the Virginian stood quiet by the bar,\\nand many an eye of astonishment was turned upon him. “I'd not stand half\\nthat language,” some muttered to each other. Still the Virginian waited\\nquietly, while the fools reasoned with Trampas. But no earthly foot can\\nstep between a man and his destiny. Trampas broke suddenly free.\\n\\n“Your friends have saved your life,” he rang out, with obscene epithets.\\n“I'll give you till sundown to leave town.”\\n\\nThere was total silence instantly.\\n\\n“Trampas,” spoke the Virginian, “I don't want trouble with you.”\\n\\n“He never has wanted it,” Trampas sneered to the bystanders. “He has\\nbeen dodging it five years. But I've got him coralled.”\\n\\nSome of the Trampas faction smiled.\\n\\n“Trampas,” said the Virginian again, “are yu' sure yu' really mean\\nthat?”\\n\\nThe whiskey bottle flew through the air, hurled by Trampas, and crashed\\nthrough the saloon window behind the Virginian.\\n\\n“That was surplusage, Trampas,” said he, “if yu' mean the other.”\\n\\n“Get out by sundown, that's all,” said Trampas. And wheeling, he went\\nout of the saloon by the rear, as he had entered.\\n\\n“Gentlemen,” said the Virginian, “I know you will all oblige me.”\\n\\n“Sure!” exclaimed the proprietor, heartily, “We'll see that everybody\\nlets this thing alone.”\\n\\nThe Virginian gave a general nod to the company, and walked out into the\\nstreet.\\n\\n“It's a turruble shame,” sighed Scipio, “that he couldn't have postponed\\nit.”\\n\\nThe Virginian walked in the open air with thoughts disturbed. “I am of\\ntwo minds about one thing,” he said to himself uneasily.\\n\\nGossip ran in advance of him; but as he came by, the talk fell away\\nuntil he had passed. Then they looked after him, and their words again\\nrose audibly. Thus everywhere a little eddy of silence accompanied his\\nsteps.\\n\\n“It don't trouble him much,” one said, having read nothing in the\\nVirginian's face.\\n\\n“It may trouble his girl some,” said another.\\n\\n“She'll not know,” said a third, “until it's over.”\\n\\n“He'll not tell her?”\\n\\n“I wouldn't. It's no woman's business.”\\n\\n“Maybe that's so. Well, it would have suited me to have Trampas die\\nsooner.”\\n\\n“How would it suit you to have him live longer?” inquired a member of\\nthe opposite faction, suspected of being himself a cattle thief.\\n\\n“I could answer your question, if I had other folks' calves I wanted to\\nbrand.” This raised both a laugh and a silence.\\n\\nThus the town talked, filling in the time before sunset.\\n\\nThe Virginian, still walking aloof in the open air, paused at the edge\\nof the town. “I'd sooner have a sickness than be undecided this way,”\\n he said, and he looked up and down. Then a grim smile came at his own\\nexpense. “I reckon it would make me sick--but there's not time.”\\n\\nOver there in the hotel sat his sweetheart alone, away from her mother,\\nher friends, her home, waiting his return, knowing nothing. He looked\\ninto the west. Between the sun and the bright ridges of the mountains\\nwas still a space of sky; but the shadow from the mountains' feet had\\ndrawn halfway toward the town. “About forty minutes more,” he said\\naloud. “She has been raised so different.” And he sighed as he\\nturned back. As he went slowly, he did not know how great was his own\\nunhappiness. “She has been raised so different,” he said again.\\n\\nOpposite the post-office the bishop of Wyoming met him and greeted him.\\nHis lonely heart throbbed at the warm, firm grasp of this friend's hand.\\nThe bishop saw his eyes glow suddenly, as if tears were close. But none\\ncame, and no word more open than, “I'm glad to see you.”\\n\\nBut gossip had reached the bishop, and he was sorely troubled also.\\n“What is all this?” said he, coming straight to it.\\n\\nThe Virginian looked at the clergyman frankly. “Yu' know just as much\\nabout it as I do,” he said. “And I'll tell yu' anything yu' ask.”\\n\\n“Have you told Miss Wood?” inquired the bishop.\\n\\nThe eyes of the bridegroom fell, and the bishop's face grew at once more\\nkeen and more troubled. Then the bridegroom raised his eyes again, and\\nthe bishop almost loved him. He touched his arm, like a brother. “This\\nis hard luck,” he said.\\n\\nThe bridegroom could scarce keep his voice steady. “I want to do right\\nto-day more than any day I have ever lived,” said he.\\n\\n“Then go and tell her at once.”\\n\\n“It will just do nothing but scare her.”\\n\\n“Go and tell her at once.”\\n\\n“I expected you was going to tell me to run away from Trampas. I can't\\ndo that, yu' know.”\\n\\nThe bishop did know. Never before in all his wilderness work had he\\nfaced such a thing. He knew that Trampas was an evil in the country,\\nand that the Virginian was a good. He knew that the cattle thieves--the\\nrustlers--were gaining, in numbers and audacity; that they led many\\nweak young fellows to ruin; that they elected their men to office, and\\ncontrolled juries; that they were a staring menace to Wyoming. His heart\\nwas with the Virginian. But there was his Gospel, that he preached, and\\nbelieved, and tried to live. He stood looking at the ground and drawing\\na finger along his eyebrow. He wished that he might have heard nothing\\nabout all this. But he was not one to blink his responsibility as a\\nChristian server of the church militant.\\n\\n“Am I right,” he now slowly asked, “in believing that you think I am a\\nsincere man?”\\n\\n“I don't believe anything about it. I know it.”\\n\\n“I should run away from Trampas,” said the bishop.\\n\\n“That ain't quite fair, seh. We all understand you have got to do the\\nthings you tell other folks to do. And you do them, seh. You never talk\\nlike anything but a man, and you never set yourself above others. You\\ncan saddle your own horses. And I saw yu' walk unarmed into that\\nWhite River excitement when those two other parsons was a-foggin' and\\na-fannin' for their own safety. Damn scoundrels!”\\n\\nThe bishop instantly rebuked such language about brothers of his cloth,\\neven though he disapproved both of them and their doctrines. “Every one\\nmay be an instrument of Providence,” he concluded.\\n\\n“Well,” said the Virginian, “if that is so, then Providence makes use of\\ninstruments I'd not touch with a ten-foot pole. Now if you was me, seh,\\nand not a bishop, would you run away from Trampas?”\\n\\n“That's not quite fair, either!” exclaimed the bishop, with a smile.\\n“Because you are asking me to take another man's convictions, and yet\\nremain myself.”\\n\\n“Yes, seh. I am. That's so. That don't get at it. I reckon you and I\\ncan't get at it.”\\n\\n“If the Bible,” said the bishop, “which I believe to be God's word, was\\nanything to you--”\\n\\n“It is something to me, seh. I have found fine truths in it.”\\n\\n“'Thou shalt not kill,'” quoted the bishop. “That is plain.”\\n\\nThe Virginian took his turn at smiling. “Mighty plain to me, seh. Make\\nit plain to Trampas, and there'll be no killin'. We can't get at it that\\nway.”\\n\\nOnce more the bishop quoted earnestly. “'Vengeance is mine, I will\\nrepay, saith the Lord.'”\\n\\n“How about instruments of Providence, seh? Why, we can't get at it that\\nway. If you start usin' the Bible that way, it will mix you up mighty\\nquick, seh.”\\n\\n“My friend,” the bishop urged, and all his good, warm heart was in it,\\n“my dear fellow--go away for the one night. He'll change his mind.”\\n\\nThe Virginian shook his head. “He cannot change his word, seh. Or at\\nleast I must stay around till he does. Why, I have given him the say-so.\\nHe's got the choice. Most men would not have took what I took from him\\nin the saloon. Why don't you ask him to leave town?”\\n\\nThe good bishop was at a standstill. Of all kicking against the pricks\\nnone is so hard as this kick of a professing Christian against the whole\\ninstinct of human man.\\n\\n“But you have helped me some,” said the Virginian. “I will go and tell\\nher. At least, if I think it will be good for her, I will tell her.”\\n\\nThe bishop thought that he saw one last chance to move him.\\n\\n“You're twenty-nine,” he began.\\n\\n“And a little over,” said the Virginian.\\n\\n“And you were fourteen when you ran away from your family.”\\n\\n“Well, I was weary, yu' know, of havin' elder brothers lay down my law\\nnight and mawnin'.”\\n\\n“Yes, I know. So that your life has been your own for fifteen years. But\\nit is not your own now. You have given it to a woman.”\\n\\n“Yes; I have given it to her. But my life's not the whole of me. I'd\\ngive her twice my life--fifty--a thousand of 'em. But I can't give\\nher--her nor anybody in heaven or earth--I can't give my--my--we'll\\nnever get at it, seh! There's no good in words. Good-by.” The Virginian\\nwrung the bishop's hand and left him.\\n\\n“God bless him!” said the bishop. “God bless him!”\\n\\nThe Virginian unlocked the room in the hotel where he kept stored his\\ntent, his blankets, his pack-saddles, and his many accoutrements for the\\nbridal journey in the mountains. Out of the window he saw the mountains\\nblue in shadow, but some cottonwoods distant in the flat between were\\nstill bright green in the sun. From among his possessions he took\\nquickly a pistol, wiping and loading it. Then from its holster he\\nremoved the pistol which he had tried and made sure of in the morning.\\nThis, according to his wont when going into a risk, he shoved between\\nhis trousers and his shirt in front. The untried weapon he placed in\\nthe holster, letting it hang visibly at his hip. He glanced out of\\nthe window again, and saw the mountains of the same deep blue. But the\\ncottonwoods were no longer in the sunlight. The shadow had come past\\nthem, nearer the town; for fifteen of the forty minutes were gone. “The\\nbishop is wrong,” he said. “There is no sense in telling her.” And he\\nturned to the door, just as she came to it herself.\\n\\n“Oh!” she cried out at once, and rushed to him.\\n\\nHe swore as he held her close. “The fools!” he said. “The fools!”\\n\\n“It has been so frightful waiting for you,” said she, leaning her head\\nagainst him.\\n\\n“Who had to tell you this?” he demanded.\\n\\n“I don't know. Somebody just came and said it.”\\n\\n“This is mean luck,” he murmured, patting her. “This is mean luck.”\\n\\nShe went on: “I wanted to run out and find you; but I didn't! I didn't!\\nI stayed quiet in my room till they said you had come back.”\\n\\n“It is mean luck. Mighty mean,” he repeated.\\n\\n“How could you be so long?” she asked. “Never mind, I've got you now. It\\nis over.”\\n\\nAnger and sorrow filled him. “I might have known some fool would tell\\nyou,” he said.\\n\\n“It's all over. Never mind.” Her arms tightened their hold of him. Then\\nshe let him go. “What shall we do?” she said. “What now?”\\n\\n“Now?” he answered. “Nothing now.”\\n\\nShe looked at him without understanding.\\n\\n“I know it is a heap worse for you,” he pursued, speaking slowly. “I\\nknew it would be.”\\n\\n“But it is over!” she exclaimed again.\\n\\nHe did not understand her now. He kissed her. “Did you think it was\\nover?” he said simply. “There is some waiting still before us. I wish\\nyou did not have to wait alone. But it will not be long.” He was looking\\ndown, and did not see the happiness grow chilled upon her face, and then\\nfade into bewildered fear. “I did my best,” he went on. “I think I did.\\nI know I tried. I let him say to me before them all what no man has\\never said, or ever will again. I kept thinking hard of you--with all\\nmy might, or I reckon I'd have killed him right there. And I gave him a\\nshow to change his mind. I gave it to him twice. I spoke as quiet as\\nI am speaking to you now. But he stood to it. And I expect he knows he\\nwent too far in the hearing of others to go back on his threat. He will\\nhave to go on to the finish now.”\\n\\n“The finish?” she echoed, almost voiceless.\\n\\n“Yes,” he answered very gently.\\n\\nHer dilated eyes were fixed upon him. “But--” she could scarce form\\nutterance, “but you?”\\n\\n“I have got myself ready,” he said. “Did you think--why, what did you\\nthink?”\\n\\nShe recoiled a step. “What are you going--” She put her two hands to her\\nhead. “Oh, God!” she almost shrieked, “you are going--” He made a step,\\nand would have put his arm round her, but she backed against the wall,\\nstaring speechless at him.\\n\\n“I am not going to let him shoot me,” he said quietly.\\n\\n“You mean--you mean--but you can come away!” she cried. “It's not too\\nlate yet. You can take yourself out of his reach. Everybody knows that\\nyou are brave. What is he to you? You can leave him in this place. I'll\\ngo with you anywhere. To any house, to the mountains, to anywhere away.\\nWe'll leave this horrible place together and--and--oh, won't you listen\\nto me?” She stretched her hands to him. “Won't you listen?”\\n\\nHe took her hands. “I must stay here.”\\n\\nHer hands clung to his. “No, no, no. There's something else. There's\\nsomething better than shedding blood in cold blood. Only think what it\\nmeans! Only think of having to remember such a thing! Why, it's what\\nthey hang people for! It's murder!”\\n\\nHe dropped her hands. “Don't call it that name,” he said sternly.\\n\\n“When there was the choice!” she exclaimed, half to herself, like a\\nperson stunned and speaking to the air. “To get ready for it when you\\nhave the choice!”\\n\\n“He did the choosing,” answered the Virginian. “Listen to me. Are you\\nlistening?” he asked, for her gaze was dull.\\n\\nShe nodded.\\n\\n“I work hyeh. I belong hyeh. It's my life. If folks came to think I was\\na coward--”\\n\\n“Who would think you were a coward?”\\n\\n“Everybody. My friends would be sorry and ashamed, and my enemies would\\nwalk around saying they had always said so. I could not hold up my head\\nagain among enemies or friends.”\\n\\n“When it was explained--”\\n\\n“There'd be nothing to explain. There'd just be the fact.” He was nearly\\nangry.\\n\\n“There is a higher courage than fear of outside opinion,” said the New\\nEngland girl.\\n\\nHer Southern lover looked at her. “Cert'nly there is. That's what I'm\\nshowing in going against yours.”\\n\\n“But if you know that you are brave, and if I know that you are brave,\\noh, my dear, my dear! what difference does the world make? How much\\nhigher courage to go your own course--”\\n\\n“I am goin' my own course,” he broke in. “Can't yu' see how it must be\\nabout a man? It's not for their benefit, friends or enemies, that I have\\ngot this thing to do. If any man happened to say I was a thief and I\\nheard about it, would I let him go on spreadin' such a thing of me?\\nDon't I owe my own honesty something better than that? Would I sit down\\nin a corner rubbin' my honesty and whisperin' to it, 'There! there! I\\nknow you ain't a thief?' No, seh; not a little bit! What men say about\\nmy nature is not just merely an outside thing. For the fact that I\\nlet 'em keep on sayin' it is a proof I don't value my nature enough to\\nshield it from their slander and give them their punishment. And that's\\nbeing a poor sort of a jay.”\\n\\nShe had grown very white.\\n\\n“Can't yu' see how it must be about a man?” he repeated.\\n\\n“I cannot,” she answered, in a voice that scarcely seemed her own. “If I\\nought to, I cannot. To shed blood in cold blood. When I heard about that\\nlast fall,--about the killing of those cattle thieves,--I kept saying to\\nmyself: 'He had to do it. It was a public duty.' And lying sleepless I\\ngot used to Wyoming being different from Vermont. But this--” she gave\\na shudder--“when I think of to-morrow, of you and me, and of-- If you do\\nthis, there can be no to-morrow for you and me.”\\n\\nAt these words he also turned white.\\n\\n“Do you mean--” he asked, and could go no farther.\\n\\nNor could she answer him, but turned her head away.\\n\\n“This would be the end?” he asked.\\n\\nHer head faintly moved to signify yes.\\n\\nHe stood still, his hand shaking a little. “Will you look at me and\\nsay that?” he murmured at length. She did not move. “Can you do it?” he\\nsaid.\\n\\nHis sweetness made her turn, but could not pierce her frozen resolve.\\nShe gazed at him across the great distance of her despair.\\n\\n“Then it is really so?” he said.\\n\\nHer lips tried to form words, but failed.\\n\\nHe looked out of the window, and saw nothing but shadow. The blue of the\\nmountains was now become a deep purple. Suddenly his hand closed hard.\\n\\n“Good-by, then,” he said.\\n\\nAt that word she was at his feet, clutching him. “For my sake,” she\\nbegged him. “For my sake.”\\n\\nA tremble passed through his frame. She felt his legs shake as she held\\nthem, and, looking up, she saw that his eyes were closed with misery.\\nThen he opened them, and in their steady look she read her answer. He\\nunclasped her hands from holding him, and raised her to her feet.\\n\\n“I have no right to kiss you any more,” he said. And then, before his\\ndesire could break him down from this, he was gone, and she was alone.\\n\\nShe did not fall, or totter, but stood motionless. And next--it seemed\\na moment and it seemed eternity--she heard in the distance a shot, and\\nthen two shots. Out of the window she saw people beginning to run. At\\nthat she turned and fled to her room, and flung herself face downward\\nupon the floor.\\n\\nTrampas had departed into solitude from the saloon, leaving behind him\\nhis ULTIMATUM. His loud and public threat was town knowledge already,\\nwould very likely be county knowledge to-night. Riders would take it\\nwith them to entertain distant cabins up the river and down the river;\\nand by dark the stage would go south with the news of it--and the news\\nof its outcome. For everything would be over by dark. After five years,\\nhere was the end coming--coming before dark. Trampas had got up this\\nmorning with no such thought. It seemed very strange to look back upon\\nthe morning; it lay so distant, so irrevocable. And he thought of how he\\nhad eaten his breakfast. How would he eat his supper? For supper would\\ncome afterward. Some people were eating theirs now, with nothing like\\nthis before them. His heart ached and grew cold to think of them, easy\\nand comfortable with plates and cups of coffee.\\n\\nHe looked at the mountains, and saw the sun above their ridges, and\\nthe shadow coming from their feet. And there close behind him was the\\nmorning he could never go back to. He could see it clearly; his thoughts\\nreached out like arms to touch it once more, and be in it again. The\\nnight that was coming he could not see, and his eyes and his thoughts\\nshrank from it. He had given his enemy until sundown. He could not\\ntrace the path which had led him to this. He remembered their first\\nmeeting--five years back, in Medicine Bow, and the words which at once\\nbegan his hate. No, it was before any words; it was the encounter of\\ntheir eyes. For out of the eyes of every stranger looks either a friend\\nor an enemy, waiting to be known. But how had five years of hate come to\\nplay him such a trick, suddenly, to-day? Since last autumn he had meant\\nsometime to get even with this man who seemed to stand at every turn\\nof his crookedness, and rob him of his spoils. But how had he come to\\nchoose such a way of getting even as this, face to face? He knew many\\nbetter ways; and now his own rash proclamation had trapped him. His\\nwords were like doors shutting him in to perform his threat to the\\nletter, with witnesses at hand to see that he did so.\\n\\nTrampas looked at the sun and the shadow again. He had till sundown. The\\nheart inside him was turning it round in this opposite way: it was to\\nHIMSELF that in his rage he had given this lessening margin of grace.\\nBut he dared not leave town in all the world's sight after all the world\\nhad heard him. Even his friends would fall from him after such an act.\\nCould he--the thought actually came to him--could he strike before the\\ntime set? But the thought was useless. Even if his friends could harbor\\nhim after such a deed, his enemies would find him, and his life would be\\nforfeit to a certainty. His own trap was closing upon him.\\n\\nHe came upon the main street, and saw some distance off the Virginian\\nstanding in talk with the bishop. He slunk between two houses, and\\ncursed both of them. The sight had been good for him, bringing some\\nwarmth of rage back to his desperate heart. And he went into a place and\\ndrank some whiskey.\\n\\n“In your shoes,” said the barkeeper, “I'd be afraid to take so much.”\\n\\nBut the nerves of Trampas were almost beyond the reach of intoxication,\\nand he swallowed some more, and went out again. Presently he fell in\\nwith some of his brothers in cattle stealing, and walked along with them\\nfor a little.\\n\\n“Well, it will not be long now,” they said to him. And he had never\\nheard words so desolate.\\n\\n“No,” he made out to say; “soon now.” Their cheerfulness seemed\\nunearthly to him, and his heart almost broke beneath it.\\n\\n“We'll have one to your success,” they suggested.\\n\\nSo with them he repaired to another place; and the sight of a man\\nleaning against the bar made him start so that they noticed him. Then he\\nsaw that the man was a stranger whom he had never laid eyes on till now.\\n\\n“It looked like Shorty,” he said, and could have bitten his tongue off.\\n\\n“Shorty is quiet up in the Tetons,” said a friend. “You don't want to be\\nthinking about him. Here's how!”\\n\\nThen they clapped him on the back and he left them. He thought of his\\nenemy and his hate, beating his rage like a failing horse, and treading\\nthe courage of his drink. Across a space he saw Wiggin, walking with\\nMcLean and Scipio. They were watching the town to see that his friends\\nmade no foul play.\\n\\n“We're giving you a clear field,” said Wiggin.\\n\\n“This race will not be pulled,” said McLean.\\n\\n“Be with you at the finish,” said Scipio.\\n\\nAnd they passed on. They did not seem like real people to him.\\n\\nTrampas looked at the walls and windows of the houses. Were they real?\\nWas he here, walking in this street? Something had changed. He looked\\neverywhere, and feeling it everywhere, wondered what this could be. Then\\nhe knew: it was the sun that had gone entirely behind the mountains, and\\nhe drew out his pistol.\\n\\nThe Virginian, for precaution, did not walk out of the front door of the\\nhotel. He went through back ways, and paused once. Against his breast\\nhe felt the wedding ring where he had it suspended by a chain from his\\nneck. His hand went up to it, and he drew it out and looked at it. He\\ntook it off the chain, and his arm went back to hurl it from him as far\\nas he could. But he stopped and kissed it with one sob, and thrust it in\\nhis pocket. Then he walked out into the open, watching. He saw men here\\nand there, and they let him pass as before, without speaking. He saw\\nhis three friends, and they said no word to him. But they turned and\\nfollowed in his rear at a little distance, because it was known that\\nShorty had been found shot from behind. The Virginian gained a position\\nsoon where no one could come at him except from in front; and the sight\\nof the mountains was almost more than he could endure, because it was\\nthere that he had been going to-morrow.\\n\\n“It is quite a while after sunset,” he heard himself say.\\n\\nA wind seemed to blow his sleeve off his arm, and he replied to it, and\\nsaw Trampas pitch forward. He saw Trampas raise his arm from the ground\\nand fall again, and lie there this time, still. A little smoke was\\nrising from the pistol on the ground, and he looked at his own, and saw\\nthe smoke flowing upward out of it.\\n\\n“I expect that's all,” he said aloud.\\n\\nBut as he came nearer Trampas, he covered him with his weapon. He\\nstopped a moment, seeing the hand on the ground move. Two fingers\\ntwitched, and then ceased; for it was all. The Virginian stood looking\\ndown at Trampas.\\n\\n“Both of mine hit,” he said, once more aloud. “His must have gone mighty\\nclose to my arm. I told her it would not be me.”\\n\\nHe had scarcely noticed that he was being surrounded and congratulated.\\nHis hand was being shaken, and he saw it was Scipio in tears. Scipio's\\njoy made his heart like lead within him. He was near telling his friend\\neverything, but he did not.\\n\\n“If anybody wants me about this,” he said, “I will be at the hotel.”\\n\\n“Who'll want you?” said Scipio. “Three of us saw his gun out.” And he\\nvented his admiration. “You were that cool! That quick!”\\n\\n“I'll see you boys again,” said the Virginian, heavily; and he walked\\naway.\\n\\nScipio looked after him, astonished. “Yu' might suppose he was in poor\\nluck,” he said to McLean.\\n\\nThe Virginian walked to the hotel, and stood on the threshold of his\\nsweetheart's room. She had heard his step, and was upon her feet. Her\\nlips were parted, and her eyes fixed on him, nor did she move, or speak.\\n\\n“Yu' have to know it,” said he. “I have killed Trampas.”\\n\\n“Oh, thank God!” she said; and he found her in his arms. Long they\\nembraced without speaking, and what they whispered then with their\\nkisses, matters not.\\n\\nThus did her New England conscience battle to the end, and, in the end,\\ncapitulate to love. And the next day, with the bishop's blessing, and\\nMrs. Taylor's broadest smile, and the ring on her finger, the Virginian\\ndeparted with his bride into the mountains.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXXXVI. AT DUNBARTON\\n\\n\\nFor their first bridal camp he chose an island. Long weeks beforehand he\\nhad thought of this place, and set his heart upon it. Once established\\nin his mind, the thought became a picture that he saw waking and\\nsleeping. He had stopped at the island many times alone, and in all\\nseasons; but at this special moment of the year he liked it best. Often\\nhe had added several needless miles to his journey that he might finish\\nthe day at this point, might catch the trout for his supper beside a\\ncertain rock upon its edge, and fall asleep hearing the stream on either\\nside of him.\\n\\nAlways for him the first signs that he had gained the true world of the\\nmountains began at the island. The first pine trees stood upon it; the\\nfirst white columbine grew in their shade; and it seemed to him that he\\nalways met here the first of the true mountain air--the coolness and the\\nnew fragrance. Below, there were only the cottonwoods, and the knolls\\nand steep foot-hills with their sage-brush, and the great warm air of\\nthe plains; here at this altitude came the definite change. Out of the\\nlower country and its air he would urge his horse upward, talking to him\\naloud, and promising fine pasture in a little while.\\n\\nThen, when at length he had ridden abreast of the island pines, he would\\nford to the sheltered circle of his camp-ground, throw off the saddle\\nand blanket from the horse's hot, wet back, throw his own clothes off,\\nand, shouting, spring upon the horse bare, and with a rope for bridle,\\ncross with him to the promised pasture. Here there was a pause in the\\nmountain steepness, a level space of open, green with thick grass.\\nRiding his horse to this, he would leap off him, and with the flat of\\nhis hand give him a blow that cracked sharp in the stillness and sent\\nthe horse galloping and gambolling to his night's freedom. And while\\nthe animal rolled in the grass, often his master would roll also, and\\nstretch, and take the grass in his two hands, and so draw his body\\nalong, limbering his muscles after a long ride. Then he would slide\\ninto the stream below his fishing place, where it was deep enough for\\nswimming, and cross back to his island, and dressing again, fit his rod\\ntogether and begin his casting. After the darkness had set in, there\\nwould follow the lying drowsily with his head upon his saddle, the\\ncamp-fire sinking as he watched it, and sleep approaching to the murmur\\nof the water on either side of him.\\n\\nSo many visits to this island had he made, and counted so many hours of\\nrevery spent in its haunting sweetness, that the spot had come to seem\\nhis own. It belonged to no man, for it was deep in the unsurveyed and\\nvirgin wilderness; neither had he ever made his camp here with any\\nman, nor shared with any the intimate delight which the place gave him.\\nTherefore for many weeks he had planned to bring her here after their\\nwedding, upon the day itself, and show her and share with her his pines\\nand his fishing rock. He would bid her smell the first true breath of\\nthe mountains, would watch with her the sinking camp-fire, and with her\\nlisten to the water as it flowed round the island.\\n\\nUntil this wedding plan, it had by no means come home to him how deep a\\nhold upon him the island had taken. He knew that he liked to go there,\\nand go alone; but so little was it his way to scan himself, his mind, or\\nhis feelings (unless some action called for it), that he first learned\\nhis love of the place through his love of her. But he told her nothing\\nof it. After the thought of taking her there came to him, he kept his\\nisland as something to let break upon her own eyes, lest by looking\\nforward she should look for more than the reality.\\n\\nHence, as they rode along, when the houses of the town were shrunk to\\ndots behind them, and they were nearing the gates of the foot-hills, she\\nasked him questions. She hoped they would find a camp a long way from\\nthe town. She could ride as many miles as necessary. She was not tired.\\nShould they not go on until they found a good place far enough within\\nthe solitude? Had he fixed upon any? And at the nod and the silence\\nthat he gave her for reply, she knew that he had thoughts and intentions\\nwhich she must wait to learn.\\n\\nThey passed through the gates of the foot-hills, following the stream up\\namong them. The outstretching fences and the widely trodden dust were\\nno more. Now and then they rose again into view of the fields and houses\\ndown in the plain below. But as the sum of the miles and hours grew,\\nthey were glad to see the road less worn with travel, and the traces of\\nmen passing from sight. The ploughed and planted country, that quilt of\\nmany-colored harvests which they had watched yesterday, lay in another\\nworld from this where they rode now. No hand but nature's had sown these\\ncrops of yellow flowers, these willow thickets and tall cottonwoods.\\nSomewhere in a passage of red rocks the last sign of wagon wheels was\\nlost, and after this the trail became a wild mountain trail. But it was\\nstill the warm air of the plains, bearing the sage-brush odor and not\\nthe pine, that they breathed; nor did any forest yet cloak the shapes\\nof the tawny hills among which they were ascending. Twice the steepness\\nloosened the pack ropes, and he jumped down to tighten them, lest the\\nhorses should get sore backs. And twice the stream that they followed\\nwent into deep canyons, so that for a while they parted from it. When\\nthey came back to its margin for the second time, he bade her notice how\\nits water had become at last wholly clear. To her it had seemed clear\\nenough all along, even in the plain above the town. But now she saw that\\nit flowed lustrously with flashes; and she knew the soil had changed to\\nmountain soil. Lower down, the water had carried the slightest cloud\\nof alkali, and this had dulled the keen edge of its transparence. Full\\nsolitude was around them now, so that their words grew scarce, and when\\nthey spoke it was with low voices. They began to pass nooks and points\\nfavorable for camping, with wood and water at hand, and pasture for the\\nhorses. More than once as they reached such places, she thought he must\\nsurely stop; but still he rode on in advance of her (for the trail\\nwas narrow) until, when she was not thinking of it, he drew rein and\\npointed.\\n\\n“What?” she asked timidly.\\n\\n“The pines,” he answered.\\n\\nShe looked, and saw the island, and the water folding it with ripples\\nand with smooth spaces. The sun was throwing upon the pine boughs a light\\nof deepening red gold, and the shadow of the fishing rock lay over a\\nlittle bay of quiet water and sandy shore. In this forerunning glow of\\nthe sunset, the pasture spread like emerald; for the dry touch of summer\\nhad not yet come near it. He pointed upward to the high mountains which\\nthey had approached, and showed her where the stream led into their\\nfirst unfoldings.\\n\\n“To-morrow we shall be among them,” said he.\\n\\n“Then,” she murmured to him, “to-night is here?”\\n\\nHe nodded for answer, and she gazed at the island and understood why he\\nhad not stopped before; nothing they had passed had been so lovely as\\nthis place.\\n\\nThere was room in the trail for them to go side by side; and side by\\nside they rode to the ford and crossed, driving the packhorses in front\\nof them, until they came to the sheltered circle, and he helped her down\\nwhere the soft pine needles lay. They felt each other tremble, and for a\\nmoment she stood hiding her head upon his breast. Then she looked round\\nat the trees, and the shores, and the flowing stream, and he heard her\\nwhispering how beautiful it was.\\n\\n“I am glad,” he said, still holding her. “This is how I have dreamed it\\nwould happen. Only it is better than my dreams.” And when she pressed\\nhim in silence, he finished, “I have meant we should see our first\\nsundown here, and our first sunrise.”\\n\\nShe wished to help him take the packs from their horses, to make the\\ncamp together with him, to have for her share the building of the fire,\\nand the cooking. She bade him remember his promise to her that he would\\nteach her how to loop and draw the pack-ropes, and the swing-ropes\\non the pack-saddles, and how to pitch a tent. Why might not the first\\nlesson be now? But he told her that this should be fulfilled later. This\\nnight he was to do all himself. And he sent her away until he should\\nhave camp ready for them. He bade her explore the island, or take her\\nhorse and ride over to the pasture, where she could see the surrounding\\nhills and the circle of seclusion that they made.\\n\\n“The whole world is far from here,” he said. And so she obeyed him, and\\nwent away to wander about in their hiding-place; nor was she to return,\\nhe told her, until he called her.\\n\\nThen at once, as soon as she was gone, he fell to. The packs and saddles\\ncame off the horses, which he turned loose upon the pasture on the main\\nland. The tent was unfolded first. He had long seen in his mind where it\\nshould go, and how its white shape would look beneath the green of\\nthe encircling pines. The ground was level in the spot he had chosen,\\nwithout stones or roots, and matted with the fallen needles of the\\npines. If there should come any wind, or storm of rain, the branches\\nwere thick overhead, and around them on three sides tall rocks and\\nundergrowth made a barrier. He cut the pegs for the tent, and the front\\npole, stretching and tightening the rope, one end of it pegged down and\\none round a pine tree. When the tightening rope had lifted the canvas to\\nthe proper height from the ground, he spread and pegged down the sides\\nand back, leaving the opening so that they could look out upon the fire\\nand a piece of the stream beyond. He cut tufts of young pine and strewed\\nthem thickly for a soft floor in the tent, and over them spread the\\nbuffalo hide and the blankets. At the head he placed the neat sack of\\nher belongings. For his own he made a shelter with crossed poles and\\na sheet of canvas beyond the first pines. He built the fire where its\\nsmoke would float outward from the trees and the tent, and near it he\\nstood the cooking things and his provisions, and made this first supper\\nready in the twilight. He had brought much with him; but for ten minutes\\nhe fished, catching trout enough. When at length she came riding over\\nthe stream at his call, there was nothing for her to do but sit and eat\\nat the table he had laid. They sat together, watching the last of the\\ntwilight and the gentle oncoming of the dusk. The final after-glow of\\nday left the sky, and through the purple which followed it came slowly\\nthe first stars, bright and wide apart. They watched the spaces between\\nthem fill with more stars, while near them the flames and embers of\\ntheir fire grew brighter. Then he sent her to the tent while he cleaned\\nthe dishes and visited the horses to see that they did not stray from\\nthe pasture. Some while after the darkness was fully come, he rejoined\\nher. All had been as he had seen it in his thoughts beforehand: the\\npines with the setting sun upon them, the sinking camp-fire, and now the\\nsound of the water as it flowed murmuring by the shores of the island.\\n\\nThe tent opened to the east, and from it they watched together their\\nfirst sunrise. In his thoughts he had seen this morning beforehand also:\\nthe waking, the gentle sound of the water murmuring ceaselessly, the\\ngrowing day, the vision of the stream, the sense that the world was shut\\naway far from them. So did it all happen, except that he whispered to\\nher again:-- “Better than my dreams.”\\n\\nThey saw the sunlight begin upon a hilltop; and presently came the sun\\nitself, and lakes of warmth flowed into the air, slowly filling the\\ngreen solitude. Along the island shores the ripples caught flashes from\\nthe sun.\\n\\n“I am going into the stream,” he said to her; and rising, he left her in\\nthe tent. This was his side of the island, he had told her last night;\\nthe other was hers, where he had made a place for her to bathe. When\\nhe was gone, she found it, walking through the trees and rocks to the\\nwater's edge. And so, with the island between them, the two bathed in\\nthe cold stream. When he came back, he found her already busy at their\\ncamp. The blue smoke of the fire was floating out from the trees,\\nloitering undispersed in the quiet air, and she was getting their\\nbreakfast. She had been able to forestall him because he had delayed\\nlong at his dressing, not willing to return to her unshaven. She looked\\nat his eyes that were clear as the water he had leaped into, and at his\\nsoft silk neckerchief, knotted with care.\\n\\n“Do not let us ever go away from here!” she cried, and ran to him as he\\ncame. They sat long together at breakfast, breathing the morning breath\\nof the earth that was fragrant with woodland moisture and with the\\npines. After the meal he could not prevent her helping him make\\neverything clean. Then, by all customs of mountain journeys, it was time\\nthey should break camp and be moving before the heat of the day. But\\nfirst, they delayed for no reason, save that in these hours they so\\nloved to do nothing. And next, when with some energy he got upon his\\nfeet and declared he must go and drive the horses in, she asked, Why?\\nWould it not be well for him to fish here, that they might be sure of\\ntrout at their nooning? And though he knew that where they should stop\\nfor noon, trout would be as sure as here, he took this chance for more\\ndelay.\\n\\nShe went with him to his fishing rock, and sat watching him. The rock\\nwas tall, higher than his head when he stood. It jutted out halfway\\nacross the stream, and the water flowed round it in quick foam, and fell\\ninto a pool. He caught several fish; but the sun was getting high, and\\nafter a time it was plain the fish had ceased to rise.\\n\\nYet still he stood casting in silence, while she sat by and watched him.\\nAcross the stream, the horses wandered or lay down in their pasture. At\\nlength he said with half a sigh that perhaps they ought to go.\\n\\n“Ought?” she repeated softly.\\n\\n“If we are to get anywhere to-day,” he answered.\\n\\n“Need we get anywhere?” she asked.\\n\\nHer question sent delight through him like a flood. “Then you do not\\nwant to move camp to-day?” said he.\\n\\nShe shook her head.\\n\\nAt this he laid down his rod and came and sat by her. “I am very glad we\\nshall not go till to-morrow,” he murmured.\\n\\n“Not to-morrow,” she said. “Nor next day. Nor any day until we must.”\\n And she stretched her hands out to the island and the stream exclaiming,\\n“Nothing can surpass this!”\\n\\nHe took her in his arms. “You feel about it the way I do,” he almost\\nwhispered. “I could not have hoped there'd be two of us to care so\\nmuch.”\\n\\nPresently, while they remained without speaking by the pool, came a\\nlittle wild animal swimming round the rock from above. It had not seen\\nthem, nor suspected their presence. They held themselves still, watching\\nits alert head cross through the waves quickly and come down through\\nthe pool, and so swim to the other side. There it came out on a small\\nstretch of sand, turned its gray head and its pointed black nose this\\nway and that, never seeing them, and then rolled upon its back in the\\nwarm dry sand. After a minute of rolling, it got on its feet again,\\nshook its fur, and trotted away.\\n\\nThen the bridegroom husband opened his shy heart deep down.\\n\\n“I am like that fellow,” he said dreamily. “I have often done the same.”\\n And stretching slowly his arms and legs, he lay full length upon his\\nback, letting his head rest upon her. “If I could talk his animal\\nlanguage, I could talk to him,” he pursued. “And he would say to me:\\n'Come and roll on the sands. Where's the use of fretting? What's the\\ngain in being a man? Come roll on the sands with me.' That's what he\\nwould say.” The Virginian paused. “But,” he continued, “the trouble is,\\nI am responsible. If that could only be forgot forever by you and me!”\\n Again he paused and went on, always dreamily. “Often when I have camped\\nhere, it has made me want to become the ground, become the water, become\\nthe trees, mix with the whole thing. Not know myself from it. Never\\nunmix again. Why is that?” he demanded, looking at her. “What is it? You\\ndon't know, nor I don't. I wonder would everybody feel that way here?”\\n\\n“I think not everybody,” she answered.\\n\\n“No; none except the ones who understand things they can't put words to.\\nBut you did!” He put up a hand and touched her softly. “You understood\\nabout this place. And that's what makes it--makes you and me as we are\\nnow--better than my dreams. And my dreams were pretty good.”\\n\\nHe sighed with supreme quiet and happiness, and seemed to stretch his\\nlength closer to the earth. And so he lay, and talked to her as he had\\nnever talked to any one, not even to himself. Thus she learned secrets\\nof his heart new to her: his visits here, what they were to him, and why\\nhe had chosen it for their bridal camp. “What I did not know at all,”\\n he said, “was the way a man can be pining for--for this--and never guess\\nwhat is the matter with him.”\\n\\nWhen he had finished talking, still he lay extended and serene; and she\\nlooked down at him and the wonderful change that had come over him,\\nlike a sunrise. Was this dreamy boy the man of two days ago? It seemed\\na distance immeasurable; yet it was two days only since that wedding\\neve when she had shrunk from him as he stood fierce and implacable. She\\ncould look back at that dark hour now, although she could not speak of\\nit. She had seen destruction like sharp steel glittering in his eyes.\\nWere these the same eyes? Was this youth with his black head of hair in\\nher lap the creature with whom men did not trifle, whose hand knew how\\nto deal death? Where had the man melted away to in this boy? For as she\\nlooked at him, he might have been no older than nineteen to-day. Not\\neven at their first meeting--that night when his freakish spirit was\\nuppermost--had he looked so young. This change their hours upon the\\nisland had wrought, filling his face with innocence.\\n\\nBy and by they made their nooning. In the afternoon she would have\\nexplored the nearer woods with him, or walked up the stream. But since\\nthis was to be their camp during several days, he made it more complete.\\nHe fashioned a rough bench and a table; around their tent he built a\\ntall wind-break for better shelter in case of storm; and for the fire he\\ngathered and cut much wood, and piled it up. So they were provided for,\\nand so for six days and nights they stayed, finding no day or night long\\nenough.\\n\\nOnce his hedge of boughs did them good service, for they had an\\nafternoon of furious storm. The wind rocked the pines and ransacked the\\nisland, the sun went out, the black clouds rattled, and white bolts of\\nlightning fell close by. The shower broke through the pine branches and\\npoured upon the tent. But he had removed everything inside from where it\\ncould touch the canvas and so lead the water through, and the rain ran\\noff into the ditch he had dug round the tent. While they sat within,\\nlooking out upon the bounding floods and the white lightning, she saw\\nhim glance at her apprehensively, and at once she answered his glance.\\n\\n“I am not afraid,” she said. “If a flame should consume us together now,\\nwhat would it matter?”\\n\\nAnd so they sat watching the storm till it was over, he with his face\\nchanged by her to a boy's, and she leavened with him.\\n\\nWhen at last they were compelled to leave the island, or see no more of\\nthe mountains, it was not a final parting. They would come back for the\\nlast night before their journey ended. Furthermore, they promised each\\nother like two children to come here every year upon their wedding day,\\nand like two children they believed that this would be possible. But\\nin after years they did come, more than once, to keep their wedding day\\nupon the island, and upon each new visit were able to say to each other,\\n“Better than our dreams.”\\n\\nFor thirty days by the light of the sun and the camp-fire light they\\nsaw no faces except their own; and when they were silent it was all\\nstillness, unless the wind passed among the pines, or some flowing water\\nwas near them. Sometimes at evening they came upon elk, or black-tailed\\ndeer, feeding out in the high parks of the mountains; and once from the\\nedge of some concealing timber he showed her a bear, sitting with an\\nold log lifted in its paws. She forbade him to kill the bear, or any\\ncreature that they did not require. He took her upward by trail and\\ncanyon, through the unfooted woods and along dwindling streams to their\\nheadwaters, lakes lying near the summit of the range, full of trout,\\nwith meadows of long grass and a thousand flowers, and above these the\\npinnacles of rock and snow.\\n\\nThey made their camps in many places, delaying several days here, and\\none night there, exploring the high solitudes together, and sinking deep\\nin their romance. Sometimes when he was at work with their horses, or\\nintent on casting his brown hackle for a fish, she would watch him with\\neyes that were fuller of love than of understanding. Perhaps she never\\ncame wholly to understand him; but in her complete love for him she\\nfound enough. He loved her with his whole man's power. She had listened\\nto him tell her in words of transport, “I could enjoy dying”; yet she\\nloved him more than that. He had come to her from a smoking pistol, able\\nto bid her farewell--and she could not let him go. At the last white-hot\\nedge of ordeal, it was she who renounced, and he who had his way.\\nNevertheless she found much more than enough, in spite of the sigh that\\nnow and again breathed through her happiness when she would watch him\\nwith eyes fuller of love than of understanding.\\n\\nThey could not speak of that grim wedding eve for a long while after;\\nbut the mountains brought them together upon all else in the world and\\ntheir own lives. At the end they loved each other doubly more than at\\nthe beginning, because of these added confidences which they exchanged\\nand shared. It was a new bliss to her to know a man's talk and thoughts,\\nto be given so much of him; and to him it was a bliss still greater to\\nmelt from that reserve his lonely life had bred in him. He never would\\nhave guessed so much had been stored away in him, unexpressed till now.\\nThey did not want to go to Vermont and leave these mountains, but the\\nday came when they had to turn their backs upon their dream. So\\nthey came out into the plains once more, well established in their\\nfamiliarity, with only the journey still lying between themselves and\\nBennington.\\n\\n“If you could,” she said, laughing. “If only you could ride home like\\nthis.”\\n\\n“With Monte and my six-shooter?” he asked. “To your mother?”\\n\\n“I don't think mother could resist the way you look on a horse.”\\n\\nBut he said, “It's this way she's fearing I will come.”\\n\\n“I have made one discovery,” she said. “You are fonder of good clothes\\nthan I am.”\\n\\nHe grinned. “I cert'nly like 'em. But don't tell my friends. They would\\nsay it was marriage. When you see what I have got for Bennington's\\nspecial benefit, you--why, you'll just trust your husband more than\\never.”\\n\\nShe undoubtedly did. After he had put on one particular suit, she arose\\nand kissed him where he stood in it.\\n\\n“Bennington will be sorrowful,” he said. “No wild-west show, after all.\\nAnd no ready-made guy, either.” And he looked at himself in the glass\\nwith unbidden pleasure.\\n\\n“How did you choose that?” she asked. “How did you know that homespun\\nwas exactly the thing for you?”\\n\\n“Why, I have been noticing. I used to despise an Eastern man because his\\nclothes were not Western. I was very young then, or maybe not so very\\nyoung, as very--as what you saw I was when you first came to Bear Creek.\\nA Western man is a good thing. And he generally knows that. But he has\\na heap to learn. And he generally don't know that. So I took to watching\\nthe Judge's Eastern visitors. There was that Mr. Ogden especially, from\\nNew Yawk--the gentleman that was there the time when I had to sit up all\\nnight with the missionary, yu' know. His clothes pleased me best of all.\\nFit him so well, and nothing flash. I got my ideas, and when I knew I\\nwas going to marry you, I sent my measure East--and I and the tailor are\\nold enemies now.”\\n\\nBennington probably was disappointed. To see get out of the train merely\\na tall man with a usual straw hat, and Scotch homespun suit of a\\nrather better cut than most in Bennington--this was dull. And his\\nconversation--when he indulged in any--seemed fit to come inside the\\nhouse.\\n\\nMrs. Flynt took her revenge by sowing broadcast her thankfulness that\\npoor Sam Bannett had been Molly's rejected suitor. He had done so much\\nbetter for himself. Sam had married a rich Miss Van Scootzer, of the\\nsecond families of Troy; and with their combined riches this happy\\ncouple still inhabit the most expensive residence in Hoosic Falls.\\n\\nBut most of Bennington soon began to say that Molly's cow-boy could be\\ninvited anywhere and hold his own. The time came when they ceased to\\nspeak of him as a cow-boy, and declared that she had shown remarkable\\nsense. But this was not quite yet.\\n\\nDid this bride and groom enjoy their visit to her family? Well--well,\\nthey did their best. Everybody did their best, even Sarah Bell. She said\\nthat she found nothing to object to in the Virginian; she told Molly so.\\nHer husband Sam did better than that. He told Molly he considered that\\nshe was in luck. And poor Mrs. Wood, sitting on the sofa, conversed\\nscrupulously and timidly with her novel son-in-law, and said to Molly\\nthat she was astonished to find him so gentle. And he was undoubtedly\\nfine-looking; yes, very handsome. She believed that she would grow to\\nlike the Southern accent. Oh, yes! Everybody did their best; and, dear\\nreader, if ever it has been your earthly portion to live with a number\\nof people who were all doing their best, you do not need me to tell you\\nwhat a heavenly atmosphere this creates.\\n\\nAnd then the bride and groom went to see the old great-aunt over at\\nDunbarton.\\n\\nTheir first arrival, the one at Bennington, had been thus: Sam Bell\\nhad met them at the train, and Mrs. Wood, waiting in her parlor, had\\nembraced her daughter and received her son-in-law. Among them they had\\nmanaged to make the occasion as completely mournful as any family party\\ncan be, with the window blinds up. “And with you present, my dear,” said\\nSam Bell to Sarah, “the absence of a coffin was not felt.”\\n\\nBut at Dunbarton the affair went off differently. The heart of the\\nancient lady had taught her better things. From Bennington to Dunbarton\\nis the good part of a day's journey, and they drove up to the gate in\\nthe afternoon. The great-aunt was in her garden, picking some August\\nflowers, and she called as the carriage stopped, “Bring my nephew here,\\nmy dear, before you go into the house.”\\n\\nAt this, Molly, stepping out of the carriage, squeezed her husband's\\nhand. “I knew that she would be lovely,” she whispered to him. And then\\nshe ran to her aunt's arms, and let him follow. He came slowly, hat in\\nhand.\\n\\nThe old lady advanced to meet him, trembling a little, and holding out\\nher hand to him. “Welcome, nephew,” she said. “What a tall fellow you\\nare, to be sure. Stand off, sir, and let me look at you.”\\n\\nThe Virginian obeyed, blushing from his black hair to his collar.\\n\\nThen his new relative turned to her niece, and gave her a flower. “Put\\nthis in his coat, my dear,” she said. “And I think I understand why you\\nwanted to marry him.”\\n\\nAfter this the maid came and showed them to their rooms. Left alone in\\nher garden, the great-aunt sank on a bench and sat there for some time;\\nfor emotion had made her very weak.\\n\\nUpstairs, Molly, sitting on the Virginian's knee, put the flower in his\\ncoat, and then laid her head upon his shoulder.\\n\\n“I didn't know old ladies could be that way,” he said. “D' yu' reckon\\nthere are many?”\\n\\n“Oh, I don't know,” said the girl. “I'm so happy!”\\n\\nNow at tea, and during the evening, the great-aunt carried out her plans\\nstill further. At first she did the chief part of the talking herself.\\nNor did she ask questions about Wyoming too soon. She reached that in\\nher own way, and found out the one thing that she desired to know. It\\nwas through General Stark that she led up to it.\\n\\n“There he is,” she said, showing the family portrait. “And a rough time\\nhe must have had of it now and then. New Hampshire was full of fine\\nyoung men in those days. But nowadays most of them have gone away to\\nseek their fortunes in the West. Do they find them, I wonder?”\\n\\n“Yes, ma'am. All the good ones do.”\\n\\n“But you cannot all be--what is the name?--Cattle Kings.”\\n\\n“That's having its day, ma'am, right now. And we are getting ready for\\nthe change--some of us are.”\\n\\n“And what may be the change, and when is it to come?”\\n\\n“When the natural pasture is eaten off,” he explained. “I have seen that\\ncoming a long while. And if the thieves are going to make us drive\\nour stock away, we'll drive it. If they don't, we'll have big pastures\\nfenced, and hay and shelter ready for winter. What we'll spend in\\nimprovements, we'll more than save in wages. I am well fixed for the\\nnew conditions. And then, when I took up my land, I chose a place where\\nthere is coal. It will not be long before the new railroad needs that.”\\n\\nThus the old lady learned more of her niece's husband in one evening\\nthan the Bennington family had ascertained during his whole sojourn with\\nthem. For by touching upon Wyoming and its future, she roused him to\\ntalk. He found her mind alive to Western questions: irrigation, the\\nIndians, the forests; and so he expanded, revealing to her his wide\\nobservation and his shrewd intelligence. He forgot entirely to be shy.\\nShe sent Molly to bed, and kept him talking for an hour. Then she showed\\nhim old things that she was proud of, “because,” she said, “we, too, had\\nsomething to do with making our country. And now go to Molly, or you'll\\nboth think me a tiresome old lady.”\\n\\n“I think--” he began, but was not quite equal to expressing what he\\nthought, and suddenly his shyness flooded him again.\\n\\n“In that case, nephew,” said she, “I'm afraid you'll have to kiss me\\ngood night.”\\n\\nAnd so she dismissed him to his wife, and to happiness greater than\\neither of them had known since they had left the mountains and come to\\nthe East. “He'll do,” she said to herself, nodding.\\n\\nTheir visit to Dunbarton was all happiness and reparation for the\\ndoleful days at Bennington. The old lady gave much comfort and advice\\nto her niece in private, and when they came to leave, she stood at the\\nfront door holding both their hands a moment.\\n\\n“God bless you, my dears,” she told them. “And when you come next time,\\nI'll have the nursery ready.”\\n\\nAnd so it happened that before she left this world, the great-aunt was\\nable to hold in her arms the first of their many children.\\n\\nJudge Henry at Sunk Creek had his wedding present ready. His growing\\naffairs in Wyoming needed his presence in many places distant from his\\nranch, and he made the Virginian his partner. When the thieves prevailed\\nat length, as they did, forcing cattle owners to leave the country or be\\nruined, the Virginian had forestalled this crash. The herds were driven\\naway to Montana. Then, in 1889, came the cattle war, when, after putting\\ntheir men in office, and coming to own some of the newspapers, the\\nthieves brought ruin on themselves as well. For in a broken country\\nthere is nothing left to steal.\\n\\nBut the railroad came, and built a branch to that land of the\\nVirginian's where the coal was. By that time he was an important man,\\nwith a strong grip on many various enterprises, and able to give his\\nwife all and more than she asked or desired.\\n\\nSometimes she missed the Bear Creek days, when she and he had ridden\\ntogether, and sometimes she declared that his work would kill him.\\nBut it does not seem to have done so. Their eldest boy rides the horse\\nMonte; and, strictly between ourselves, I think his father is going to\\nlive a long while.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Virginian, by Owen Wister\\n\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE VIRGINIAN ***\\n\\n***** This file should be named 1298-0.txt or 1298-0.zip *****\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/2/9/1298/\\n\\nProduced by Bill Brewer\\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\\nwill be renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\\n\\n\\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\\n\\n\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\nworks.\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\n\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\n\\n\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\n\\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\\n\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n\""

Beer quart bottle dollar I never met saving price I found complaint make Through folding door I passed bar proper bottle elk head back hall various table I saw man sliding card case across table another man laying counter Near second dealer pulling card bottom pack opposite solemn old rustic piling changing coin upon card lay already exposed But I heard voice drew eye far corner room “ Why

drummer clearing throat “ Yes. ” Steve whispering delighted oath joy applying Virginian one unprintable name another We listened word came Listening hard I could half make progress heavy breathing restless turning I could clearly detect This wretched drummer He waiting But wait long Again light creak light step He even going put boot fatal neighborhood dreamer By happy thought Medicine Bow

The door burst open flew commercial traveller stocking One hand held lump coat trouser suspender dangling boot clutched The sight u stopped flight short He gazed boot fell hand profane explosion Medicine Bow set united unearthly noise began play Virginia reel The occupant bed already sprung clothed chiefly pistol ready war “ What ” demanded “ What ” “ Why I reckon 's drink Steve ” said

“ Then 'd better find another jackass ” replied quietly I glad I asked clean towel From commercial traveller I separated wandered alone pleasurable aimlessness It seven o'clock Medicine Bow stood voiceless unpeopled The cow-boys melted away The inhabitant indoors pursuing business idleness forenoon Visible motion none No shell upon dry sand could lie lifeless Medicine Bow Looking store I saw proprietor sitting pipe extinct Looking saloon I saw dealer dealing dumbly Up sky cloud bird earth lightest straw lay becalmed Once I saw Virginian open door golden-haired landlady stood talking Sometimes I strolled town sometimes plain I lay day dream sagebrush Pale herd antelope distance near demure prairie-dogs sat scrutinized Steve Trampas riot horseman lost trunk Uncle Hughey abortive

announced text I 've got one ” said Molly Wood joining u She stood tiptoe spoke comically ear “ I said haste All men liar ” This made u merry stood among chair congested hall I left lady sought bunk house I heard cheer I curious also see men taking There little eye There much noise room They getting ready come church -- brushing hair shaving making clean amid talk occasionally profane continuously diverting “ Well I 'm Christian anyway ” one declared “ I 'm Mormon I guess ” said another “ I belong Knights Pythias ” said third “ I 'm Mohammedist ” said fourth “ I hope I ai n't goin hear nothin shock me. ” And went joking But Trampas joking He lay bed reading newspaper took pain look pleasant My eye considering blithe Scipio came “ Do n't look bashful ” said “ There 's u girl here. ” He helping Virginian move belonging bunk house foreman 's cabin He occupy Virginian 's old bed “ And I hope sleepin bring luck ” said Scipio “ Yu 'd ought 've seen u told u quiet way Well ” Scipio sighed little “ must feel good friend glad you. ” “ Especially Trampas ” said I “ The Judge know ” I added “ Knows What 's say ” Scipio drew quickly bunk house “ Says 's business his. ” “ Said nothing ” Scipio 's curiosity seemed strangely intense “ Made suggestion Not thing ” “ Not thing Said n't want know n't care. ” “ How happen hear ” snapped Scipio “ You told ” immediately guessed “ He never would. ” And Scipio jerked thumb Virginian appeared moment lighted window new quarter arranging “ He never would tell ” Scipio repeated “ And Judge never made suggestion ” muttered nodding darkness “ So 's notion Just like come think Only I n't expect -- well I guess could surprise day tried. ” “ You 're surprising ” I said “ What 's ” “ Oh Trampas. ” “ What Nothing surely happened yet ” I curious Scipio “ No yet But will. ” “ Great Heavens man ” “ Just soon Trampas make first move ” Scipio replied easily I became dignified Scipio evidently told thing Virginian “ Yes I asked plumb ” Scipio answered “ I liftin trunk door I could n't stand longer I asked plumb 'Yu 've sure got Trampas yu want That 's I said And answered told So I know. ” At point Scipio stopped I know “ I idea ” I said “ system held much meanness. ” “ Oh ai n't meanness ” And laughed ecstatically “ What call ” “ He 'd call discretion ” said Scipio Then became serious “ It's blamed grand tell yu I 'll leave yu see happen Keep around 's Keep around I pretty near wish I n't know myself. ” What feeling Scipio 's discretion human curiosity I mood best profit sermon Yet even though expectation cruelly left quivering mid air I sure much I really wanted “ keep around. ” You therefore understand Dr. MacBride able make prayer read Scripture without conscious word uttered It I saw opening manuscript sermon I suddenly remembered I sitting speak church began think preacher congregation Our chair front line course next wall I could easily see cow-boys behind They perfectly decorous If Mrs. Ogden looked pistol daredevil attitude forth must greatly disappointed Except weather-beaten cheek eye simply American young men mustache without might sitting say Danbury Connecticut Even Trampas merged quietly general placidity The Virginian sure look like Danbury frame feature showed mass eye upon Dr. MacBride creamlike propriety Our missionary choose Miss Wood 's text He made selection another Psalms came I dare look anybody I much nearer unseemly conduct cow-boys Dr. MacBride gave u text sonorously “ 'They altogether become filthy There none doeth good one ” His eye showed u plainly present company excepted He repeated text launching upon discourse gave none u ray hope I heard often preached cow-boys took new glare untimeliness grotesque obsoleteness -- one say “ Let persuade admire woman ” forthwith hold bleached bone The cow-boys told could good contrive would help Nay honest deed availed nothing even accepted especial creed explained necessary salvation still might save Their sin indeed cause damnation yet keeping sin might nevertheless lost It settled born Adam shaped Having told invited glorify Creator scheme Even damned must praise person made expressly damnation That I heard prove logic cow-boys Stone upon stone built black cellar theology leaving beautiful park sunshine garden He tell splendor past noble fortress good tonic strengthened generation father No wrath spoke never love It bishop 's way I knew well hold cow-boys homely talk special hardship temptation And fell spoke forgiveness brought encouragement But Dr. MacBride never thought life waif Like like mankind invisible dot creation like feel nothing swept potent heat faith So thrust none sweet bitter creed naked stern iron Dogma poor humanity nothing flesh canon Thus kill chance use seemed deplorable evidently Their attention merely wandered Three hundred year ago would frightened electric day I saw Scipio stifling smile came doctrine original sin “ We know truth ” said Dr. MacBride “ severe trouble distress infant liable death passing upon capable sinning. ” Yet I knew good man I also knew missionary tactless might almost well bad I said attention wandered I forgot Virginian At first attitude might mere propriety One look respectfully preacher internally breaking commandment But even text I saw real attention light Virginian 's eye And keeping track concentration grew minute made sermon short He missed nothing Before end gaze preacher become swerveless Was convert critic Convert incredible Thus hour passed I thought time When took variously The preacher genial spoke broken ground lesson hoped instil He discoursed trout-fishing rumored uneasiness Indians northward going It plain personal safety never gave thought He soon bade u good night The Ogdens shrugged shoulder amused That way taking Dr. MacBride sat heavily Judge's shoulder shrug As leading citizen Territory kept open house comer Policy good nature made bid welcome wide variety traveller The cow-boy employment found bed meal horse missionary well received Sunk Creek Ranch “ I suppose I 'll take fishing ” said Judge ruefully “ Yes dear ” said wife “ And I shall make tea six days. ” “ Otherwise ” Ogden suggested “ might reported enemy religion. ” “ That 's ” said Judge “ I get people But elephant depress me. ” So named Doctor “ Jumbo ” I departed quarter At bunk house comment similar highly salted The men going bed In spite outward decorum service liked told “ altogether become filthy. ” It easy call name could And appealed several speaking like concerted piece opera “ Say believe baby go hell ” -- “ Ah course don't. ” -- “ There ai n't hereafter anyway. ” -- “ Ai n't ” -- “ Who told yu ” -- “ Same man told preacher sifted set sons-of-guns. ” -- “ Well I 'm going stay Mormon. ” -- “ Well I 'm going quit fleeing temptation. ” -- “ 's Better get neck good time poor one. ” And forth Their wit extreme yet I like Dr. MacBride heard One fellow put natural soul pretty well word “ If I happened learn predestinated I 'd thing show 'em ” And Trampas And Virginian They The Virginian gone straight new abode Trampas lay bed asleep sullen ever “ He ai n't got religion trip ” said Scipio “ Did new foreman get ” I asked “ Huh It would spoil You keep around 's Keep around. ” Scipio probed I went still baffled repose No light burned cabin I approached door The Virginian 's room quiet dark Dr. MacBride slumbered plainly audible even I entered Go fishing I thought I undressed And I selfishly decided Judge might privilege entirely Sleep came fairly soon spite Doctor I wakened bed 's jolted -- pleasant thing night I must started And quiet voice Virginian told sorry accidentally disturbed This disturbed good deal But step go bunk house sensational mind suggested He wearing much dimness seemed taller common I next made bending Dr. MacBride The divine last sprang upright “ I armed ” said “ Take care Who ” “ You lay gun seh I feel like spirit going bear witness I feel like I might get enlightening. ” He using missionary 's language The baffling I treated Scipio melted nothing Did living men petrify I changed mineral sheet The Doctor got bed lighted lamp found book two retired Virginian 's room I could hear exhortation I lay amazed In time Doctor returned blew lamp settled I much awake nearly gone sleep door creaked Virginian stood Doctor

Before blowing light looked watch thereupon I inquired hour “ Three ” said I could sleep I lay watching darkness “ I 'm afeared alone ” said Virginian 's voice presently next room “ I 'm afeared. ” There short pause shouted loud “ I 'm losin desire afteh sincere milk Word ” “ What What 's What ” The Doctor 's cot gave great crack started listening I put face deep pillow “ I 'm afeared I 'm

empty air came stone wall So sat eye upon inexorable blank sheet lay waiting turned vacant hopelessness upon sundry object room And thus sat accomplishing nothing opposite black head bent steady pen

“ And I n't guess ” said Lin “ I much shufflin folk child more. ” Whereupon Virginian shook hand silently understood well On day Virginian parted Molly beside weight farewell lay heavy heart thought also grave news The cattle thief grown audacious Horses cattle missed man began almost doubt neighbor “ Steps taken soon somebody I reckon ” said lover “ By ” asked quickly “ Most likely I 'll get mixed it. ” “ What ” “ Ca n't say I 'll tell yu I come back. ” So part leaving kiss word remember And Bennington meanwhile Dunbarton Those three letter mere outside moved Mrs. Taylor produced content much painful disturbance It remembered Molly wrote mother great-aunt That announcement mother undertaken first Its composition occupied three hour half filled eleven page counting postscript upon

With thought I combated fancy footprint made immediately front u sign presence eye could see But fancy overcame thought It shame held asking question Virginian Had one horse served case Justice cottonwood I wondered One horse -- strangling noose dragged two saddle empty signal Most likely therefore people -- Was I going back nursery I brought short And I told steady lurked brain-process going beneath reason threat worse childish apprehension created I reminded I man grown twenty-five year old I must merely seem like one feel like one “ You 're afraid dark I suppose ” This I uttered

little wind blew stone shape upward eddying And round corner upward came fluttering leaf newspaper caught edge close “ What 's latest ” inquired Virginian horse For I dismounted picked leaf “ Seems interesting ” I next heard say “ Ca n't tell man 's making eye bug ” “ Yes ” voice replied sounded like stranger speaking lightly near “ oh yes Decidedly interesting. ” My voice mimicked pronunciation “ It 's quite latest I imagine You better read yourself. ” And I handed smile watching countenance brain felt cloud rushing I saw eye quietly run heading “ Well ” inquired scanning side “ I n't seem

ride many mile necessary She tired Should go found good place far enough within solitude Had fixed upon And nod silence gave reply knew thought intention must wait learn They passed gate foot-hills following stream among The outstretching fence widely trodden dust Now rose view field house plain But sum mile hour grew glad see road le worn travel trace men passing sight The ploughed planted country quilt many-colored harvest watched yesterday lay another world rode No hand nature 's sown crop yellow flower willow thicket tall cottonwood Somewhere passage red rock last sign wagon wheel lost trail became wild mountain trail But still warm air plain bearing sage-brush odor pine breathed forest yet cloak shape tawny hill among ascending Twice steepness loosened pack rope jumped tighten lest horse get sore back And twice stream followed went deep canyon parted When came back margin second time bade notice water become last wholly clear To seemed clear enough along even plain town But

If come wind storm rain branch thick overhead around three side tall rock undergrowth made barrier He cut peg tent front pole stretching tightening rope one end pegged one round pine tree When tightening rope lifted canvas proper height ground spread pegged side back leaving opening could look upon fire piece stream beyond He cut tuft young pine strewed thickly soft floor tent spread

provision made first supper ready twilight He brought much ten minute fished catching trout enough When length came riding stream call nothing sit eat table laid They sat together watching last twilight gentle oncoming dusk The final after-glow day left sky purple followed came slowly first star bright wide apart They watched space fill star near flame ember fire grew brighter Then sent tent cleaned dish visited horse see stray pasture Some darkness fully come rejoined All seen thought beforehand pine setting sun upon sinking camp-fire sound water flowed murmuring shore island The tent opened east watched together first sunrise In thought seen morning beforehand also waking gentle sound water murmuring ceaselessly growing day vision stream sense world shut away far So happen except whispered -- “ Better dreams. ” They saw sunlight begin upon hilltop presently came sun lake warmth flowed air slowly filling green solitude Along island shore ripple caught flash sun “ I going stream ” said rising left tent This side island told last night made place bathe When gone found walking tree rock water 's edge And island two bathed cold stream When came back found already busy camp The blue smoke fire floating tree loitering undispersed quiet air getting breakfast She able forestall delayed long dressing willing return unshaven She looked eye clear water leaped soft silk neckerchief knotted care “ Do let u ever go away ” cried ran came They sat long together breakfast breathing morning breath earth fragrant woodland moisture pine After meal could prevent helping make everything clean Then custom mountain journey time break camp moving heat day But first delayed reason save hour loved nothing And next energy got upon foot declared must go drive horse asked Why Would well fish might sure trout nooning And though knew stop noon trout would sure took chance delay She went fishing rock sat watching The rock tall higher head stood It jutted halfway across stream water flowed round quick foam fell pool He caught several fish sun getting high time plain fish ceased rise Yet still stood casting silence sat watched Across stream horse wandered lay pasture At length said half sigh perhaps ought go “ Ought ” repeated softly “ If get anywhere to-day ” answered “ Need get anywhere ” asked Her question sent delight like flood “ Then want move camp to-day ” said She shook head At laid rod came sat “ I glad shall go till to-morrow ” murmured “ Not to-morrow ” said “ Nor next day Nor day must. ” And stretched hand island stream exclaiming “ Nothing surpass ” He took arm “ You feel way I ” almost whispered “ I could hoped 'd two u care much. ” Presently remained without speaking pool came little wild animal swimming round rock It seen suspected presence They held still watching alert head cross wave quickly come pool swim side There came small stretch sand turned gray head pointed black nose way never seeing rolled upon back warm dry sand After minute rolling got foot shook fur trotted away Then bridegroom husband opened shy heart deep “ I like fellow ” said dreamily “ I often done same. ” And stretching slowly arm leg lay full length upon back letting head rest upon “ If I could talk animal language I could talk ” pursued “ And would say 'Come roll sand Where 's use fretting What 's gain man Come roll sand That 's would say. ” The Virginian paused “ But ” continued “ trouble I responsible If could forgot forever ” Again paused went always dreamily “ Often I camped made want become ground become water become tree mix whole thing Not know Never unmix Why ” demanded looking “ What You n't know I n't I wonder would everybody feel way ” “ I think everybody ” answered “ No none except one understand thing ca n't put word But ” He put hand touched softly “ You understood place And 's make -- make -- better dream And dream pretty good. ” He sighed supreme quiet happiness seemed stretch length closer earth And lay talked never talked one even Thus learned secret heart new visit chosen bridal camp “ What I know ” said “ way man pining -- -- never guess matter him. ” When finished talking still lay extended serene looked wonderful change come like sunrise Was dreamy boy man two day ago It seemed distance immeasurable yet two day since wedding eve shrunk stood fierce implacable She could look back dark hour although could speak She seen destruction like sharp steel glittering eye Were eye Was youth black head hair lap creature men trifle whose hand knew deal death Where man melted away boy For looked might older nineteen to-day Not even first meeting -- night freakish spirit uppermost -- looked young This change hour upon island wrought filling face innocence By made nooning In afternoon would explored nearer wood walked stream But since camp several day made complete He fashioned rough bench table around tent built tall wind-break better shelter case storm fire gathered cut much wood piled So provided six day night stayed finding day night long enough Once hedge bough good service afternoon furious storm The wind rocked pine ransacked island sun went black cloud rattled white bolt lightning fell close The shower broke pine branch poured upon tent But removed everything inside could touch canvas lead water rain ran ditch dug round tent While sat within looking upon bounding flood white lightning saw glance apprehensively answered glance “ I afraid ” said “ If flame consume u together would matter ” And sat watching storm till face changed boy 's leavened When last compelled leave island see mountain final parting They would come back last night journey ended Furthermore promised like two child come every year upon wedding day like two child believed would possible But year come keep wedding day upon island upon new visit able say “ Better dreams. ” For thirty day light sun camp-fire light saw face except silent stillness unless wind passed among pine flowing water near Sometimes evening came upon elk black-tailed deer feeding high park mountain edge concealing timber showed bear sitting old log lifted paw She forbade kill bear creature require He took upward trail canyon unfooted wood along dwindling stream headwater lake lying near summit range full trout meadow long grass thousand flower pinnacle rock snow They made camp many place delaying several day one night exploring high solitude together sinking deep romance Sometimes work horse intent casting brown hackle fish would watch eye fuller love understanding Perhaps never came wholly understand complete love found enough He loved whole man 's power She listened tell word transport “ I could enjoy dying ” yet loved He come smoking pistol able bid farewell -- could let go At last white-hot edge ordeal renounced way Nevertheless found much enough spite sigh breathed happiness would watch eye fuller love understanding They could speak grim wedding eve long mountain brought together upon else world life At end loved doubly beginning added confidence exchanged shared It new bliss know man 's talk thought given much bliss still greater melt reserve lonely life bred He never would guessed much stored away unexpressed till They want go Vermont leave mountain day came turn back upon dream So came plain well established familiarity journey still lying Bennington “ If could ” said laughing “ If could ride
