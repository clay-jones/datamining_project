VOL. 100.



June 27, 1891.




A WAIL FROM THE TUB.

A REMINISCENCE OF SUNDAY, THE 14TH OF JUNE.

    SCENE.--_Hyde Park. Demonstration in progress, with the not
    unreasonable object of inducing Parliament to extend the
    Factory Acts to small and insanitary laundries. A lengthy
    procession, composed of sympathetic Railway Workers, Cabmen,
    Journeymen Tailors, Gas Stokers, House-Decorators, Carpenters,
    &c., &c., alt with resplendent banners and hired bands, has
    marched into the Park, together with some lorries and drags
    containing deputations of ladies from the laundry in the
    highest possible spirits. Once arrived, each platform chiefly
    concerns itself with the grievances of its own particular
    supporters, while a crowd of sightseers circulates, enjoying
    the oratory with a desultory impartiality. The usual
    silhouettes of gesticulating speakers appear like jerky
    clockwork figures above the throng. A crowd of Socialists
    are "remembering Chicago" in a corner. The chief centre of
    attraction is a drag occupied by a Philanthropic Young-lady
    Chairwoman, her chaperon, some leading laundresses, one or two
    male sympathisers, and a couple of reporters. The_ Chairwoman
    _conducts the proceedings with the greatest possible tact
    and grace, but is slightly hampered by the levity of a crowd
    composed of factory-girls, semi-imbecile larrikins, and
    professional laundresses, whose burning anxiety for reform
    masks itself under a surface frivolity. In the neighbourhood
    is a lorry decorated with clean shirts, and occupied by young
    washerwomen fired by an enthusiasm which manifests itself in
    bursts of shrill cheering and lively interchange of chaff
    with the spectators. In the meantime, the business of this
    particular platform proceeds somewhat as follows:--_

_The Chairwoman_ (_with patient good-humour_). Now, I'm sure you'll
all be as quiet as you can while I ... (_Hubbub, caused by a personal
altercation between two Women in the crowd, and shouts of "Order!"_)
Because really my doctor has ordered me not to speak in the open air
at all ... (_Here an ill-conditioned female, taking offence for some
inscrutable reason, remarks loudly,_ "_'Er_ doctor, indeed, she's
a beauty, _she_ is--'er and 'er doctor!" _More calls to order, and
extreme indignation of the ill-conditioned female at being informed
that she is "no lady," and had "better 'old 'er jaw"; ribald and
utterly meaningless jests by the larrikins._) Order, _please_!
(_Imploringly._) I know you won't make it harder for me than you can
help. (_A young Lady in a very tall hat and feather is heard demanding
that the Gentleman in front of her should remove his "boxer," on
pain of obliging her to remove it herself; the question is argued at
length._) ... You all know the purpose for which we have ... (_Here
an enthusiastic old Lady on the drag begins to cheer aimlessly, and
wave a scrubbing-brush; the Laundresses on the lorry join in._) Well,
we're going to ask Parliament ... (_Another female in crowd_: "'Ullo,
there's Mrs. JINNINGS, along with the toffs! I want to 'ear Mrs.
JINNINGS speak, I do!") ... I shall now ask you to listen to a
speaker--Mrs. GOFFIN--who has had several years' practical experience
of laundry-work, and she will tell you, I am sure, what the hardships
and injustices are which we are trying to put an end to.

    [Mrs. GOFFIN, _a stout, red-faced Lady, mounts the seat with a
    cheery confidence, amidst roars of laughter, and shouts of "Go
    it, old girl!" "Don't forgit to send my shirt home next week!"
    &c., &c. The female in the crowd repeats her preference
    for_ Mrs. JINNINGS' _oratory; a string of factory-girls, in
    high-feathered hats, having just elbowed their way into the
    throng, suddenly conceive a desire to "get a breath o' air
    somewhere," and accordingly push and trample their way out
    again with a Parthian discharge of refined raillery--after
    which_ Mrs. GOFFIN's _voice becomes audible._

[Illustration: "I've been and spoke to hover forty Members o'
Parlyment myself!"]

_Mrs. Goffin_. Why, I've been and spoke to hover forty Members o'
Parlyment on the subjeck myself, I 'ave, and they was all on our
side, 'cept three or four, as was lawyers--and you know what _they_
are! (_The crowd expresses hearty disapproval of the Profession as a
body._) One on 'em sez to me, "My good woman, I'm against 'aving the
Factory Acts. I'm all for freedom, I am!" "So am _I_ all for freedom,"
I sez, "but ..." (_Here another disturbance takes place; a little man,
with red whiskers, has mildly objected to being leant upon by a burly
stranger, who bawls_--"What are you afraid on? You ain't bin fresh
painted, 'ave yer? Are yer 'oller inside--or what? Ga arn--I never
knoo a carrotty-'aired man good for anything yet," &c., &c.) Then
there's Mr. MATTHEWS, the 'OME SECKERTARY, _'e's_ against us, which
I think 'e must be a woman-'ater hisself! (_Feeling suggestion from
crowd that the_ HOME SECRETARY _has suffered a disillusion in his
younger days._) But I was goin' to tell yer what we poor women 'ave
got to put up with. Now there's a Mrs. HIRONMOULD, of Starch Row,
Hacton Green, as I've worked for. (_A Lady in crowd, who knows_ Mrs.
H. "Ah, _she's_ a beauty!" _Cheers for_ Mrs. HIRONMOULD.) Well, I'll
tell yer something about _'er_--it'll jest show you what _she_ is!
Why, that woman, as I know myself, she acshally ... (_She relates
a personal and Rabelaisian reminiscence of_ Mrs. H., _to the huge
delight of the audience._) I'll tell yer another thing--I've worked
for a man down at South End, Healing, and this'll show yer the amount
o' hinsult and hill-treatment we 'ave to stand, and never say nothing
to. I've seed 'im, hover and hover agen, walkin' about among us in his
shirtsleeves, with 'is braces 'angin' about is 'eels! (_Cheers from
the crowd; demonstration with scrubbing-brush by the old Lady in the
drag._) I 'ave indeed, and I don't tell yer no lies. (_Here a Lady in
the crowd suddenly exhibits a tendency to harangue the public on her
own wrongs, and has to be suppressed._) And that man 'e'd come up to
me and say, "Ain't them shirts finished yet?" he sez. "No," I'd say to
'im, "they ain't, and I don't deceive yer." "It's time they was," he'd
say. "Beggin' your pardon," I'd tell 'im, "it's nothink o' the kind;
and, if you don't believe _my_ word, you may go and call your Missis
out of the back kitching, as knows more about it than you do!" An' are
you goin' to tell _me_ we ain't to 'ave a Factory Act, after _that_?

    [_She stands down, having made the speech of the afternoon,
    and is rewarded by approving cries of "Good old girl!" An
    employer of labour is next introduced, and received at first
    with suspicion, until he explains that he is heart and soul
    with them, that he does not dread the application of the
    Factory Acts to his own establishment, and considers that it
    would be an excellent thing if all the smaller laundries were
    closed to-morrow, whereupon the ladies habitually employed in
    these places cheer him heartily._

_A Common-Sense Speaker_. It's all very well for you to come 'ere and
protest against the laundresses workin' too long hours, but I tell yer
_this_--it's yer own fault, it's the Public's fault. You _will_ 'ave
yer clean shirts and collars sent 'ome every week! (_Several of the
unwashed betray that this thrust has gone home._) A fortnight ain't a
_bit_ too long to wait for your linen! (_Unanimous and hearty assent
by people in dingy flannels._) And if some o' these swells and
aristocrats weren't so partickler, and didn't send so much linen
to the wash as they do, why, it stands to reason as the hours the
washerwomen 'ud work 'ud be shorter!

    [_Chorus of agreement; sudden unpopularity--especially, oddly
    enough, with lighthearted young laundresses--of persons
    in the crowd whose collars are at all aggressive in their
    cleanliness; universal feeling that the blame has been fitted
    upon the right shoulders at last. More speeches; simultaneous
    passing of Resolution; the Processions march away with colours
    flying and bands playing, and, if they have succeeded in
    advancing the true interests of labour, no one will be more
    gratified than their friend, Mr. Punch._

JOSEPH'S JOUST.

    [Mr. CHAMBERLAIN, from the study of a certain "Liberal
    Leaflet" triumphantly draws the large conclusion that the
    Gladstonians have "dropped Home Rule."]

  To "ride the high horse," my brave Brummagem boy,
  Is doubtless, to you, a delight and a joy;
  But little avails that equestrian quest,
  If the fruit of your ride is the merest "mare's nest."

"PALMAM QUI MERUIT, FERAT!"

[Illustration: "It takes time to get ever such journeys and such
experiences."--_Mrs. Grimwood on her Manipur adventures._]

Mr. PUNCH, _loquitur_:--

  True, Madam, and tasteless would be the intrusion
    That tactlessly took no account of the time
  The  praises of Britons are yours, in profusion;
    The blame for a blunder, the judgment for crime,
  Let Statesmen apportion; all know where the Honour
    In Manipur's ill-managed business is due;
  And _Punch_, whose delight is of praise to be donor,
    Without hesitation awards it to _you_!

  The terrible tale of that sudden disaster
    Is vivid in memory, fresh on our ear;
  We know how a tender-souled woman could master
    The anguish of horror, the tremor of fear.
  That short brave defence will long live in our story.
    That long dreadful march England will not forget;
  Though womanhood finds little comfort in glory,
    For hearts that are aching and eyes that are wet.

  Enough for to-day! When slow time has brought healing.
    The tale of those hours by your lips may be told.
  But proud admiration will scarce brook concealing,
    And _Punch_ to express it is courteously bold.
  He speaks for all England. For womanly valour
    We men have not shaped the right guerdon,--our loss!
  A brave woman's heart flushing red o'er fear's pallor,
    Deserves--what _Punch_ gives--the Victoria Cross!

       *       *       *       *       *

"Their acquaintance," observed Counsel, in a recent Breach of Promise
Case, "began in a 'bus." This may have been an error of expression, or
a misprint, as "began _with_ a buss" would have been more likely.

ANOTHER JUBILEE!--The Jubilee of the COOK Tourist System will be
celebrated July 22nd by a Banquet at the Métropole. The dinner ought
to be A 1 with such a COOK.

SUMMERY MUMMERY.

I do not know how long the Summer Season at TERRY's, now being carried
on by Mr. GEORGE EDWARDES, is to last, but with a little dexterous
management there is no reason why this excellent form of entertainment
should not go on all the year round. At 8 there is _The Lancashire
Sailor_, by BRANDON THOMAS, which I didn't see; but have heard a
first-rate report of it from those who have, and who "know." It might
occasionally change places with _A Commission_. However, this is but
a suggestion, as both the pieces I saw the other night will bear a
second visit.

_A Commission_ is a short one-act piece, with a sufficiently good
plot, and every part in it a character, except "_Parker_, the
Maid"--and here let me enter a solemn protest against the further use
of "PARKER" as the name of a lady's-maid in farce or comedy. PARKER is
played out. Let her be united to "CHARLES, his Friend," and let both
enjoy their well-earned retirement from the stage.

Miss LILY HANBURY plays "_Mrs. Hemmersley_, a rich young widow," which
cannot be described as "a poor part." With this LILY, who looks rich
and is beautiful, the poor artist--a very poor artist--one _Marshall_
(without a Christian name in the bill, so why not _Snelgrove
Marshall_?) well played by Dr. FORBES DAWSON, falls desperately in
love. WEEDON GROSSMITH is very good as the servant--almost better as
the servant than as the author of the piece, and that's saying a good
deal.

The _Pantomime Rehearsal is_ eminently funny; especially the first
scene between the four men, Messrs. ELLIOT, DANEMORE, GROSSMITH, and
BRANDON THOMAS. As for the last-mentioned, it is well worth a visit
to this theatre to see Mr. BRANDON THOMAS in two pieces, first as the
Model, and then as the Heavy Swell. It is a strong thing to say, but
I can call to mind no actor on the stage at the present moment who
could in two different characters on the same night so completely
and absolutely lose his identity,--for voice, manner, action, and of
course appearance are all utterly changed,--as does Mr. BRANDON THOMAS
as _Gloucester_ the Model, and as _Captain Tom Robinson_.

All the ladies are good. Miss HELENA DACRE looks magnificent. Then
Miss EDITH CHESTER combines prettiness with fun, and the duet between
her and clever Miss LAURA LINDEN is enthusiastically _encored_--and
deservedly so, for it is seldom that two young actresses will "go in"
for a real genuine bit of nonsensical burlesque, and win. In fact it
is all good, "and if our friends in front" will accept my tip, they
will not find a more "summery" form of entertainment than at Mr.
EDWARDES' TERRY's Theatre.

HOW IT HAPPENED;

_OR, MANY A TRU(RO) WORD SAID IN JEST._

"And the See of Truro, your Gracious MAJESTY?" asked Lord SALISBURY,
as he was packing up his portfolio, previous to leaving the Presence.

"Ah!" said the QUEEN, "for the moment I had forgot"--

"Quite so, your MAJESTY, if you will graciously pardon the
interruption," put in the PREMIER--"that's the very person I would
suggest."

"Did I mention a name?" inquired the QUEEN, somewhat puzzled.

"Your MAJESTY," replied the noble Earl, "observed that 'you had
forgot.' I would suggest that the Bishopric of Truro should be _for
GOTT_." Of course it was at once settled, and a _congé d'élire_
issued.

ETON JUBILEE CURIOSITIES.

[Illustration: FLOREAT ETONA!

_Mr. Punch_ (_to King Henry's "holy shade"_). "CONGRATULATIONS, YOUR
MAJESTY, ON THE 400TH ANNIVERSARY!"]

    [If the following have been omitted from the Catalogue, any
    visitor to Eton is entitled to call on the Provost, Fellows,
    and Head Master, and ask for an explanation.]

1. "_I'm Monarch of all I Survey._" Original copy of ballad sung by
the First Eton Ten-oar.

2. Old Sketch (landscape) of the Very Cross Roads near Surley Hall.
Also portrait of SURLY HALL himself.

3. "_A Night on the Brocas_." Old poem, supposed to be the original of
the scene "on the Brocken" in _Faust_. A curious mistake of GOETHE's,
probably due to his not having been educated at Eton.

4. The original "funny" owned by Master JOSEPH MILLER, supposed to
have provided him with the notion for his first jest.

*** Also the original jest itself, bottled in high spirits, and in
a fair state of preservation. As clearly as can be deciphered, the
legend is something about "an Indian," "an oarsman," and "feathering a
scull," or "skull."

5. A dissertation on the text that "The weakest goes to the
Wall," showing how this proverb has been for many years directly
contradicted, not only in theory but in practice during the Foot-ball
time; it being at Eton the strongest who invariably go to "the Wall."

6. A finely illustrated poem on a bathing subject. It is called
"_The Passing of Arthur_." The picture shows the Masters on the bank
at Cuckoo Ware, while one small natational Candidate is still in a
punt shiveringly awaiting the command to jump in again and swim the
regulation distance. From the title, it may be taken for granted that
this ARTHUR did "pass" after all. Poor little chap!

7. "_Going a Cropper off the Acropperlis at Athens_." Another bathing
subject--unsigned.

MOMUS ON MANIPUR.

  Sentiment, GORST, to your stern soul,
    May seem a "Simple Simon;"
  But if there _be_ a cheaper _rôle_,
    'Tis that of twopenny Timon!

Twin MOTTO.--"_You mustn't speak to the Man at the Wheel_" has become
a proverbial expression. It stood alone. Now it has a companion; it
comes from the hand of "A Master." It is, "_You must not speak to the
Gentlemen of the Jury._" The exceptions which prove this rule are in
favour of the Judge, the Counsel, the Clerk, and the Usher.

THE LOST SERGEANT.

    [In a recent case before Mr. Justice CHITTY, a doubt was
    expressed as to whether there was still such an officer as the
    Sergeant-at-Arms attending the Courts. His services had not
    been required since 1879. After some inquiry, however, he was
    discovered.]

  SERGEANT-AT-ARMS, where wert thou? Haply pensioned
    In some remote and solitary spot;
  By lips judicial never even mentioned,
    The Courts forgetting, by the Courts forgot.
  Far from thy kind in some provincial village,
  Didst thou devote thy hoary age to tillage?

  Didst thou, perchance to lower heights declining
    Lately, as busman, strike for higher pay?
  Or, to the lash of fate thy soul resigning,
    Wear a red cap and drive a brewer's dray?
  Or didst thou on a hansom seek to fleece men,
  And scorn the fair, and battle with policemen?

  Or, didst thou play (as often I have seen a
    Musician play in snow, or sleet, or rain)
  The cornet or expansive concertina
    Outside a public-house, and all in vain?
  Music hath charms, but public-house men mock it,
  Let loose an oath, but button up their pocket.

  Or, didst thou write, as some have done, a shocker,
    And sell it on the stalls of Mr. SMITH?
  Or, write us versicles like FREDERICK LOCKER,
    Or, ANDREW-LANG-like, talk about a myth?
  Or, by thine own success amazed and staggered,
  Make Zulus make thee rich, like Mr. HAGGARD?

  Or, like BUCHANAN, didst thou quite exhaust in
    One volume such abuse as fits a barge?
  Twitter and chirp like Mr. ALFRED AUSTIN,
    Or make a trifle mystically large,
  Like SWINBURNE, round whose verse the fog grows stronger
  Just in proportion as his lines are longer?

  Whate'er thou didst, where'er thou wert, we found thee.
    "Behold!" we cried, "the Sergeant reappears."
  Let not our welcome overmuch astound thee,
    Whom we have missed through twelve unhappy years.
  Restored at length to England, home, and beauty,
  Sergeant-at-Arms advance, and do thy duty!

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.

_House of Commons, Monday, June 15_.--RICHARD CHAMBERLAIN back
to-night, after long absence. Been up the Nile, calling on PTOLEMY and
PHARAOH, and visiting scenes connected with the early life of Brother
JOSEPH. Much enjoyed the trip; entered House to-night full of life and
energy; suddenly pulled up; hair rose; flesh crept; blood chilled.
Was it true? Could it be possible? Yes; no doubt about it. There was
Prince ARTHUR still lounging on Treasury Bench with MADDEN in reserve.
About a score of Members present, including WINDBAG SEXTON, looking on
with his irritating smile of supreme superiority, whilst SAGE of QUEEN
ANNE'S GATE moved rejection of Irish Land Purchase Bill.

[Illustration: Brother Dick]

"Why!" exclaimed Brother DICK, his hair still visibly rising, "when I
was here last, weeks and months ago, they were discussing Irish Land
Bill; Prince ARTHUR sprawled on Treasury Bench; LABBY was denouncing
the Bill as pernicious; and SEXTON, having just sat down and just
going to follow, looked on with sort of pitying toleration of other
people who assumed to know anything of the Bill. Do I dream, or are
there visions about? Think I'll go and pinch JESSE COLLINGS, and see
if I'm awake."

Yes; wide awake; no mistake about the situation; still harping on the
Irish Land Bill; but, thank a merciful Providence, this is the last
night. JOHN MORLEY, who never shrinks from call of duty, rises, and
makes one of those formal, official, somewhat tiresome protests,
recapitulating objections which everyone only too familiar with
through this gruesome spring and saddened summer. Then SAGE OF QUEEN
ANNE'S GATE cracks a few jokes; MORTON appears on scene; attempt made
to Count Out; talk kept going through dinner hour. At eleven o'clock
Prince ARTHUR rises; benches fill up; then, when everyone ready for
Division, strangers in Gallery startled by mighty roar of execration;
looking round with startled gaze in search of explanation, discover at
corner-seat below Gangway a dapper figure uplifted on supernaturally
high-heeled boots, with trousers tightly drawn to display proportions
of limbs that would have made _Sim Tappertit_ green with envy; a black
frock coat, buff waistcoat, coloured tie, a high collar, a wizened
countenance, just now wrinkled with spasmodic contortion, kindly meant
for an ingratiating smile.

This is SEYMOUR KEAY. House may roar at him as the dog that crosses
the Epsom Course when the bell rings for the Derby is howled at. He
has, in return for the contumely, only a smile, a deprecatory wave of
the hand and a speech. House keeps up the roar; KEAY waves his ringed
hand, nods pleasantly at the SPEAKER, and at anything approaching
a lull, shouts half a sentence at top of his voice. For full ten
minutes contest continued. Then SPEAKER rises; KEAY sits down, glad
of interval of rest, and hopeful that SPEAKER is about to rebuke his
interrupters.

"The question is," said the SPEAKER, "that this Bill be now read a
Third Time." Before KEAY realised situation, House is cleared for
Division, and his final speech on Land Purchase Bill remains unspoken.

_Business done._--Irish Land Bill read a Third Time by 225 votes
against 96.

_Tuesday._--GORST gave House to-night thorough surprise. The SQUIRE
of MALWOOD brought on Manipur business; moved Resolution asking for
more papers. Incidentally indicted the Government at home and in
India. GORST put up to reply. An average Minister would have made an
ordinary speech; GORST's reply accepted by common consent as the most
extraordinary ever heard from the Treasury Bench since DIZZY left
it. Instead of evading responsibilities, colouring facts, doing what
Ministers usually do when in a fix, GORST simply, boldly, cynically,
told the truth. The SENAPATTI of MANIPUR was an ambitious, capable,
popular man who might breed mischief for the rule of the EMPRESS
of INDIA. So the SENAPATTI must be got rid of at earliest possible
moment, and in most absolutely complete fashion. Arbitrary this;
tyrannical perhaps; unjust possibly. None of GORST's business to
defend or extenuate it. All he could say was it is not a new thing;
done wherever British flag waves under foreign skies; in New Zealand
with the Maori King; in South Africa with CETEWAYO; in Egypt with
ARABI; in the Soudan with ZEBEHR. "In India," said GORST, leaning his
elbow lightly on the table, "they have always hated and discouraged
independent and original talent; always loved and promoted
mediocrity."

As he finished this pregnant and delightful aphorism, GORST looked up
at the Peers' Gallery, where sat his Chief, GRAND CROSS, successor of
CLIVE in the Government of India. His glance travelled downward, till
it rested on the Treasury Bench, and fell gently on the figure of OLD
MORALITY.

How DIZZY would have delighted in this speech, with this last
exquisite touch! The SQUIRE of MALWOOD, in his secret breast, not less
appreciative; but debate must be kept up, and he joined in the hue
and cry with which Mediocrity resented this fresh and original way
of treating things. Even CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN shook his head. "It is
brilliant," he said, "but it is not discretion."

_Business done._--A good deal.

_Thursday._--Government met with awkward defeat on Factories Bill.
Not quite certain to whom they chiefly owe it, whether to GORST or
MATTHEWS. Question arose on SYDNEY BUXTON's Amendment, raising the
age of child-labourers to a minimum of eleven years. Debate lasted all
night; a pleasant contrast to the unreality of Irish Debate; Benches
crowded; audience interested; speeches practical; GORST in attendance,
though doubtful whether he would speak. Usually sits in modest
retirement under shadow of SPEAKER's Chair. To-night marked slight
difference of opinion from his colleagues by taking up corner-seat on
Treasury Bench by Gangway, quite out of reach of hand-shake from HOME
SECRETARY.

[Illustration: No Relation of Prince Arthur's.]

MUNDELLA, longing to be at MATTHEWS, waiting on Front Opposition
Bench; MATTHEWS, earnestly desiring collision with MUNDELLA, lingered
the long night through on Treasury Bench. At last dragged into arena
by JOHN MORLEY. Painfully conscious of GORST on his right hand. Why
couldn't he go away? Why sit there smiling when MATTHEWS floundered,
and why turn over the pages of the Blue Book with such subtle air
of contradiction when MATTHEWS quoted from proceedings of Berlin
Conference?

As midnight drew on, excitement increased. Uncertain how Division
would go. Rumours of possible defeat of the Government; AKERS-DOUGLAS
moving about smiling; therefore all must be well. House surging with
excitement; movement to and fro; a buzz of conversation rising above
the voice of Member addressing the Chair. Only one placid figure under
the glass roof. Seated in side Gallery facing Treasury Bench was J.S.
BALFOUR; (no relation of Prince ARTHUR's, _bien entendu_) Question
put; Division bell rang; the bustle of eight hundred departing feet
disturbed J.S.B., and, stepping carefully down from the inconveniently
high Bench, he walked out to take part in the Division.

"All very well, dear TOBY," he said, "talking about eleven being the
age for half-timers. Eleven seems to me about the figure at which we
should knock off here. When it gets on to twelve in this hot weather,
I almost feel as if I could go to sleep." _Business done._--SYDNEY
BUXTON's Amendment to Factories Bill carried by 202 Votes against 186.

_Friday._--Question to-night, how would Government take their defeat
of yesterday? Soon settled; at earliest moment MATTHEWS appeared
at table, announced that Government "fully and cordially" accepted
decision of House. It was true that they had resisted, with fullest
strength, SYDNEY BUXTON's proposal. He himself, in powerful speech,
had demonstrated that, if Amendment were added to the Bill, the
heavens would fall, and the British Empire would stagger to its doom.
But that only his play; GORST really obliged to the House for beating
them, and Clause would be added to Bill. Done accordingly. Report
stage of Factories' Bill run through, and Third Reading taken.

Odd thing befell the universe last week. Happening to mention in this
Diary WOOTON ISAACSON, Member for Tower Hamlets, the dissolute Artist
drew fancy portrait of LEWIS ISAACS, Member for Newington; labelled
it from _Dod_, "A Progressive Conservative." Oddly enough, both
ISAACS and ISAACSON write themselves down in _Dod_ "A Progressive
Conservative." So our Artist (occasionally quite clear-headed),
got mixed up with the family; descended, so to speak, from ISAAC to
ISAAC'S SON. Not quite sure to which apology is due. Just as well
to mention it, so that, when the New Zealander reads his _Punch_ a
century or two hence, he may have a clear conception of the actuality.
_Business done_.--Quite a lot.

"THE SHODKIN."

    [In a Jewish divorce case it was alleged that the petitioner
    and respondent had been brought together by a "Shodkin." The
    Shodkin, it was explained, was a person who brought about
    marriages between members of the Jewish community, and was
    paid a fee by one or both the parties.]

  "I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word."--_Merchant of Venice_.

  "Give me new rhymes," the poet cries,
    "I want another rhyme for 'bodkin,'"
  And here comes dropping from the skies
    That comfortable word, "the Shodkin."

  Long have I racked my brain for rhymes,
    I tried to drag in Mr. GODKIN;
  On Friday last I read my _Times_,
    _Eureka!_ down it goes--the Shodkin.

  We live by verse, and how shall we
    This Hebrew middle-man disparage,
  To whom religion grants a fee,
    Paid by both sides, for making marriage?

  Nay, Jew, we thank thee for the word,
    For Fate two Jews might haply sever;
  The busy Shodkin comes as third,
    And swiftly makes them one for ever.

AN OPERATIC PUZZLE.

I had been informed that it was no use buying a book of _Mireille_,
as those sold in the house were of a somewhat light and mis-leading
character. So I didn't. But I had a programme, and fortunately I was
able to recognise most of the singers in spite of their disguise. Also
I comforted myself with the official information that the piece was
to be performed, "by desire, in French." "Oho!" says I, to myself,
"there is some sensible person on the Committee who doesn't understand
Italian, and prefers 'French as she is sung.'" However, I recognised
but one of the Covent Garden Committee men present, and he was there
only in a casual sort of way. DRURIOLANUS wasn't _en évidence_;
probably at home rehearsing various effects with a view to receiving
the Imperial Majesty of Germany. These receptions, including "such a
getting up (and down) stairs," walking with crab-like action, require
a lot of rehearsal, not to mention the management of a sword which
is apt to be dangerous only to the wearer, and the carrying of
wax-lights, the effect of which on his official Court dress may recall
to the mind of the Operatic Manager the celebrated name of GRISI.
There was no one in authority to tell me anything about _Mireille_,
and this is what I made out of the plot.

_Mireille_, Miss EAMES, charming throughout, is a happy peasant
in beautiful little patent leather shoes, which, I hope, are
as easy as apparently are her circumstances. She is beloved by
one _Vincent_, pronounced _Van Song_, a peasant of a rather
Whitechapelish-costermongerish-out-on-a-Sunday appearance, but
picturesque withal. They are engaged; at least, if they are not they
ought to be. Then comes a handsome elderly lady, disguised like a
fairy godmother in a pantomime before she throws off her hood and
announces her real character, and this lady, called _Taven_ in the
bill, is Mlle. PASSAMA, who sings a song about a _papillon_, for what
particular reason I do not know, except to please the audience, which
it did, being encored, and to puzzle _Mireille_, in which it also
succeeded, if I might judge by Miss EAMES's expressive countenance.
And here I must observe that I found my intimate acquaintance with
the French language almost useless, for except an occasional "_oui_,"
given, as _Jeames_ has it, "in excellent French," and for some
allusions to "_le papillon_" just mentioned, and "_et alors_"--which
didn't help me much, even when given twice most dramatically by M.
ISNARDON,--I couldn't catch a single word, and as far as libretto
went, it might have been, for me personally, given in double-Dutch,
or the dialect of a South-African tribe.

[Illustration: The Wicked Vibrato Peasant with the big
Toasting-cum-Tuning-Fork.]

On the disappearance of _Taven_,--[she didn't take off her cloak, and
wasn't a fairy, which rather put me off the scent, I admit,]--in comes
a gorgeous person, six feet high at least, and stout in proportion,
who, as I gathered from the programme, was _Ourrias_ (what a name!),
played by Signor CESTE, and sung with a kind of double vibrato stop in
his organ, which seemed, when turned on full, to make the upper boxes
quiver. Well, in he comes, and tells _Mireille_ something--what,
I don't know--but this is how the row began, as, in less than five
minutes, two old men, one M. ISNARDON, dramatic and in tune, and
the other, not mentioned in my programme, and therefore pardonably
somewhat out of tune, enter and commence a rumpus; what the difficulty
was all about I am not clear, but the upshot was that the old man in
tune cursed his daughter, and the old man out of tune held back his
son VINCENT, and prevented him from first assaulting and then being
assaulted by the irate _Maître Ramon_, i.e., M. ISNARDON. The Chorus
of Unhappy Villagers forms _tableau_. End of Act the Second; in Act
the First there was no action at all, and everything had gone off as
pleasantly as possible.

[Illustration: The Happy Peasant Boy with his Long Pipe.]

Then, in Act III., there is a sandy desert--where?--Egypt?--Heaven,
AUGUSTUS HARRIS, and the scene-painter, only know--and here comes on
a mighty illigant shepherd with a pipe--to play, not to smoke--and
one clever person near me was sure it was Miss EAMES in disguise, but
it turned out to be Miss REGINA PINKERT, a piper of whom some present
would willingly have paid to hear a little more; but she vanished,
probably in search of her flock in the desert,--by the way, an
excellent place for golf this desert,--and then in came _Mireille_ and
_Taven_, when the latter, I fancy, tells _Mireille_ of the crime she
has witnessed in the previous scene, which, I regret to say, I have
omitted to mention from motives of delicacy. But alas! I can no longer
conceal the fact. In that previous scene _Mr. Ourrias_ had behaved
very badly in first losing his temper, and then sticking a dagger into
poor _Vincent Lubert_, who fell down behind a rock, presumably dead.

The golf-ground is cleared off, and we are back again in front of the
village church. But at this moment a person, who knew all about it,
whispered, "If you want to get your cab, and escape the crush, now's
the time, as the Opera is just over." So I hurried off, and to this
moment I haven't the faintest idea how it all ended, and I don't quite
understand how it began. However, I have recorded my impressions,
confused probably, but--the music is very pretty, and Miss EAMES very
charming.

PARENTAL AUTHORITY.

_Typical British Father_ (_according to the Home Secretary_). Now,
come, JANE and JIM, bundle up to your work. Look sharp!

_Government Inspector_. No, Mr. SIKES, I think not. Your youngsters
have not touched eleven yet.

_Typical British Father_. But they're over ten.

_Government Inspector_. That don't matter. The age is altered. You'll
just send your young kids back to the Board School again.

_Typical British Father_. Well, I call it downright robbery. Why, they
supports me, they do; and what more fitter work can you find for the
kids, but to support their parients with the sweat of their brow. Why,
I thought the 'OME SECRETARY was all on our side.

_Government Inspector_. Well, he's been beat, that's all. The country
don't see the fun of sending children of tender years away from their
proper training, to wear out their young bodies and poison their young
systems in beastly close, ill-ventilated work-rooms, and all just to
bring in an extra bit of money to enable their parents, like you, to
laze and loaf at home, and, maybe, spend their hardly-earned wage on
drink. However, you'll have to dock it, Mr. SIKES.

_Typical British Father_. Well, I call it downright bloomin' robbery.
It's more. It's a invasion of the sacred rights of the British
working man's domestic home. It's a infringement of the liberty of the
subject, that's wot it is. It's a teaching the young 'uns rebellion
against their natural protectors. It's a bloomin' shame!

    [Government Inspector _leads them off delighted_. Typical
    British Father _left swearing_.

UNSELFISH HELP BY SMILES.--"Dr. QUAIN's advice to doctors," says
Mr. JAMES PAYN in the _Illustrated London News_, "always 'to look
cheerful,' ought to be written in letters of gold." So it is: in
notes, or cheques. When the eminent novelist has to send for Dr.
QUAIN, the latter will beam on him, and tell him a good story. The
labour he delights in will "physic PAYN."

(_VERY FREELY ADAPTED FROM_ THOMAS HOOD.)

_Fond Mother_. I really take it vastly kind,
     This visit, my dear creature!
    A family likeness here you'll find.
      (Like _hers_? Not in one feature!)

_Friendly Visitor_. Only too happy, I am sure,
      To see the little darling,
    Our family friendships _are_ so pure!
     (They find effect in snarling.)

_Fond Mother_. Well, dear, with _your_ experience,
      Your aid must be of value.
    You've not yet given its help immense.
     (Nor, if I know it, _shall_ you!)

_Friendly Visitor_. Ah! Good Nurse G-SCH-N, is she out,
      That you the babe are dandling?
    Sweet-tempered child and strong, no doubt!
      (The brat wants careful handling.)

_Fond Mother_. G-SCH-N and D-KE are both at hand,
      But I'm so proud to show it.
    The weakness _you_ will understand
     (Envious, and knows I know it!)

_Friendly Visitor_. Mothers must be as vigilant
      As--say 'Bus-strikers' pickets.
    It cries, dear! What does baby want?
      (Half-starved, and has the rickets!)

_Fond Mother_. Which, think you, the best Infant's Food?
      You see there are so many;
    I know your judgment is so good!
      (Not worth a single penny!)

_Friendly Visitor_. Well, dear, don't swaddle it too tight.
      That ruins the digestion,
    And--Forster's Food I've found work right.
     (She'll relish _that_ suggestion!)

_Fond Mother_. Humph! Rather out of date, I fear!
      You've slight experience--_lately_--
    Next time you nurse you'll know, my dear!
       (She'll like that home-thrust _greatly_!)

_Friendly Visitor_. Your nursing, dear, of course, is based
      Upon my Nursery Manual.
    The child looks _rayther_ peaky-faced.
     (Not quite a hardy annual!)

_Fond Mother_. Think so? Look up, and laugh, my sweet,
      Show NANA she's mistaken--
    It quite begins to "feel its feet."
      (With spite her soul is shaken!)

_Friendly Visitor_. I understand your family
      Call it "The Changeling." Why so?
    The family likeness _all_ must see.
      (It squints with the left eye so!)

_Fond Mother_. Oh! there are always _some_ cross things
      In _every_ Family Party.
    _Your_ mother's heart has felt such stings!
      (She'll think of JOE and HARTY!)

_Friendly Visitor_. Well, well, with my advice, my dear,
      And lots of Liberal Tonic,
    Your child we possibly may rear.
      (That's one for Old Sardonic!)

_Fond Mother_. Oh! really you are quite _too_ kind!
      Your own "Home-Rule Elixir"
    Unfailing for your babes you find?
      (Fancy _that_ dart will fix her!)

_Friendly Visitor_. You see we breed, and nurse, our own;
      _We_ do not steal or borrow.
    However, dear, I must be gone.
      (To call again to-morrow!)

_Fond Mother_. What! must you go? Next, time no doubt.
      You'll give more Liberal measure.
    Nurse G. shall see you safely out,
      (With most particular pleasure!)

_Friendly Visitor_. Don't trouble, dear! The bell I'll pull,
      And, bid them call my cabby!
    Good bye! The Babe's be-you-ti-ful!

"KNOWLEDGE IS INVALUABLE!"

    SCENE--_Royal Commission of the Future. Commissioners present.
    Last Witness under examination._

_Chairman_. And now, my lad, you have learned everything.

_Witness_ (_modestly_). Yes, my Lord and Gentlemen, up to a certain
point.

_Chairman_. Quite so--you have, generally speaking, an education
rather better than an average City Clerk?

_Witness_ (_in the same modest tone_). So I am given to understand.

_Chairman_. What is your father?

_Witness_. An artisan. But pardon me, I think I can anticipate and
answer the next question. I am entirely unfit to follow my parent's
calling--physically and morally. My frame has been weakened by study,
and my education prevents--.

_Chairman_ (_interrupting_). Just so. We can hardly expect a lad of
fourteen who is good enough to floor the London matriculation taking
to bricklaying? (_Murmurs of general assent_.) Well, my boy, have you
tried to get a clerkship?

_Witness_. Alas! yes, indeed I have, my Lord and Gentlemen. I have
tried everywhere to obtain employment, but without success.

_Chairman_ (_sympathetically_). Dear me! Very sad! But come, my
lad, we have given you something more than an ordinary commercial
education--you have acquired accomplishments.

_Witness_. Yes, my Lord and Gentlemen; but, believe me, they are
valueless. I am an excellent violinist, but there is no room for me at
the theatres. It is true I might, by paying my footing, secure a place
in a strolling band, consisting of a harp and a cornet, but I have
conscientious scruples against earnings gained at the doors of a
public-house.

_Chairman_. Certainly. Besides, I fancy you make too light of the
difficulties of securing such a position. A Witness, who gave very
much the same evidence as yourself, declared it was impossible to gain
admission even to a German Band. But you have learned drawing?

_Witness_. Yes; but I find the accomplishment valueless as a
bread-winner. I would do pastels on the flag-stones were not the
supply of artists in this particular line greatly in excess of the
demand. Besides, the police move them on.

_Chairman_. Well, my lad, what can you do for yourself?

_Witness_. Nothing; and consequently, my Lord and Gentlemen, I hope
you will do something for me.

_Chairman_ (_after consultation with his colleagues_). As you have
been educated up to a point rendering you valueless at fourteen,
we shall have much pleasure in recommending that your studies be
continued until your education will be equally valueless at nineteen.
If this scheme does nothing else, it will keep you employed for the
next five years! [_Scene closes in upon the Report._

ORATORIO, AS HANDLED AT THE C.P.

The Tenth Triennial Handel Festival. Programme extends over three
days, Monday, to-day the 24th, and Friday the 26th. The singers are
Madame ALBANI, Miss MARIAN MCKENZIE, Messrs. SANTLEY, EDWARD LLOYD,
BARTON MCGUCKIN, BRIDSON, and BRERETON--the last pair seeming to come
in like the "two pretty men" of nursery history, 'yclept "ROBIN and
RICHARD." The great organ cannot be played without EYRE and bellows.
The Conductor to the musical omnibus is AUGUST MANNS, or more
appropriately, JUNE MANNS. _Motto_.--"MANNS wants but little here
below, but he wants that uncommonly good"--and more than good it is
safe to be in the hands of the Conductor whose name is indicative of
quantity and quality. _Salvete, Homines!_

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.

The Baron is getting along with GEORGE MEREDITH's _One of Our
Conquerors_. Within the last three weeks he has already reached p.
94 of Vol. I, and here the weather, having suddenly become tropical,
the Baron felt that his mighty brain "whirled, swam to a giddiness,
and subsided." He has been stopped occasionally _en route_; he had
come into view of "_the diminutive marble cavalier of the infantile
cerebellum_." Then he retraced his steps, puzzled a bit, but after
a "modest quencher" Swivellerian libation, he hit upon a luminous
passage which warned him "_in plain speech_"--and whose is plainer
than GEORGE MEREDITH's?--"_that the Bacchus of auspicious birth
induces ever to the worship of the loftier Deities._" Excellent i'
faith! And then the Baron smole, as one who is interiorly enlightened
smileth as he read, "_Forbear to come hauling up examples of malarious
men_"--("'malarious men' is good," quoth the Baron)--"_in whom these
pourings of the golden rays of life breed fogs; and be moved, since
you are scarcely under an obligation to hunt the meaning_"--(here the
Baron wondered within himself. Was he under an obligation or not?
In _foro conscientiæ_ the case was set down for that immortal date.
"_To-morrow_")--"_in tolerance of some dithyrambic inebriety of
narration_ (_quiverings of the reverent pen_) _when we find ourselves
entering the circle of a most magnetic popularity._" Here the Baron
paused. Somehow, in his search after truth, he had fallen down some
seventy pages, and was on his back again at p. 33, Vol. I. Refreshment
was necessary. Iced. Also a Nicotinian sacrifice, as of primitive
days, when heifers, adorned, not altars, but weeds, vegetables, and
early produce only. _Smokeamus! Veni, vidi, visky!_ 'Fore GEORGE! Your
health and novel!

"AS EASY AS ABC."

_Witness of the Labour Commission_ (_under examination_). Yes, I think
that employers should be forced by law to give in to their men.

_Question_. But should this lead to bankruptcy, what then?

_Witness_. Bankruptcy should be legally abolished.

_Question_. Should employers have no money to pay the employed?

_Witness_. That duty should be discharged by the Government.

_Question_. But bow should the loss be supplied--by the imposition of
new taxes?

_Witness_. Certainly not. Taxation should be entirely abolished.

_Question_. Then how could your scheme be carried out?

_Witness_ (_courteously_). That is a matter I leave entirely to the
discretion of the Government.
