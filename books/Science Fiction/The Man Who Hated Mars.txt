out of a crack-proof exile campâget onto a ship that couldnât be

do all these things, but he discovered that Mars did evil things to
men; that he wasnât even Clayton any more. He was onlyâ_




The Man Who Hated Mars

By RANDALL GARRETT


âI WANT you to put me in prison!â the big, hairy man said in a
trembling voice.

He was addressing his request to a thin woman sitting behind a desk
that seemed much too big for her. The plaque on the desk said:

LT. PHOEBE HARRIS
TERRAN REHABILITATION SERVICE

Lieutenant Harris glanced at the man before her for only a moment
before she returned her eyes to the dossier on the desk; but long
enough to verify the impression his voice had given. Ron Clayton was a
big, ugly, cowardly, dangerous man.

He said: âWell? Dammit, say something!â

The lieutenant raised her eyes again. âJust be patient until Iâve read
this.â Her voice and eyes were expressionless, but her hand moved
beneath the desk.

[Illustration] The frightful carnage would go down in the bloody
history of space.

Clayton froze. _Sheâs yellow!_ he thought. Sheâs turned on the
trackers! He could see the pale greenish glow of their little eyes
watching him all around the room. If he made any fast move, they would
cut him down with a stun beam before he could get two feet.

She had thought he was going to jump her. _Little rat!_ he thought,
_somebody ought to slap her down!_

He watched her check through the heavy dossier in front of her.
Finally, she looked up at him again.

âClayton, your last conviction was for strong-arm robbery. You were
given a choice between prison on Earth and freedom here on Mars. You
picked Mars.â

He nodded slowly. Heâd been broke and hungry at the time. A sneaky
little rat named Johnson had bilked Clayton out of his fair share of
the Corey payroll job, and Clayton had been forced to get the money
somehow. He hadnât mussed the guy up much; besides, it was the suckerâs
own fault. If he hadnât tried to yellâ

Lieutenant Harris went on: âIâm afraid you canât back down now.â

âBut it isnât fair! The most Iâd have got on that frame-up wouldâve
been ten years. Iâve been here fifteen already!â

âIâm sorry, Clayton. It canât be done. Youâre here. Period. Forget
about trying to get back. Earth doesnât want you.â Her voice sounded
choppy, as though she were trying to keep it calm.

Clayton broke into a whining rage. âYou canât do that! It isnât fair! I
never did anything to you! Iâll go talk to the Governor! Heâll listen
to reason! Youâll see! Iâllââ

â_Shut up!_â the woman snapped harshly. âIâm getting sick of it! I
personally think you should have been locked upâpermanently. I think
this idea of forced colonization is going to breed trouble for Earth
someday, but it is about the only way you can get anybody to colonize
this frozen hunk of mud.

âJust keep it in mind that I donât like it any better than you doâ_and
I didnât strong-arm anybody to deserve the assignment!_ Now get out of
here!â

She moved a hand threateningly toward the manual controls of the stun
beam.

Clayton retreated fast. The trackers ignored anyone walking away from
the desk; they were set only to spot threatening movements toward it.

Outside the Rehabilitation Service Building, Clayton could feel the
tears running down the inside of his face mask. Heâd asked again and
againâGod only knew how many timesâin the past fifteen years. Always
the same answer. No.

When heâd heard that this new administrator was a woman, heâd hoped she
might be easier to convince. She wasnât. If anything, she was harder
than the others.

The heat-sucking frigidity of the thin Martian air whispered around him
in a feeble breeze. He shivered a little and began walking toward the
recreation center.

There was a high, thin piping in the sky above him which quickly became
a scream in the thin air.

He turned for a moment to watch the ship land, squinting his eyes to
see the number on the hull.

Fifty-two. Space Transport Ship Fifty-two.

Probably bringing another load of poor suckers to freeze to death on
Mars.

That was the thing he hated about Marsâthe cold. The everlasting damned
cold! And the oxidation pills; take one every three hours or smother in
the poor, thin air.

The government could have put up domes; it could have put in
building-to-building tunnels, at least. It could have done a hell of a
lot of things to make Mars a decent place for human beings.

But noâthe government had other ideas. A bunch of bigshot scientific
characters had come up with the idea nearly twenty-three years before.
Clayton could remember the words on the sheet he had been given when he
was sentenced.

âMankind is inherently an adaptable animal. If we are to colonize the
planets of the Solar System, we must meet the conditions on those
planets as best we can.

âFinancially, it is impracticable to change an entire planet from its
original condition to one which will support human life as it exists on
Terra.

âBut man, since he is adaptable, can change himselfâmodify his
structure slightlyâso that he can live on these planets with only a
minimum of change in the environment.â


So they made you live outside and like it. So you froze and you choked
and you suffered.

Clayton hated Mars. He hated the thin air and the cold. More than
anything, he hated the cold.

Ron Clayton wanted to go home.

The Recreation Building was just ahead; at least it would be warm
inside. He pushed in through the outer and inner doors, and he heard
the burst of music from the jukebox. His stomach tightened up into a
hard cramp.

They were playing Heinleinâs _Green Hills of Earth_.

There was almost no other sound in the room, although it was full of
people. There were plenty of colonists who claimed to like Mars, but
even they were silent when that song was played.

Clayton wanted to go over and smash the machineâmake it stop reminding
him. He clenched his teeth and his fists and his eyes and cursed
mentally. _God, how I hate Mars!_


When the hauntingly nostalgic last chorus faded away, he walked over to
the machine and fed it full of enough coins to keep it going on
something else until he left.

At the bar, he ordered a beer and used it to wash down another
oxidation tablet. It wasnât good beer; it didnât even deserve the name.
The atmospheric pressure was so low as to boil all the carbon dioxide
out of it, so the brewers never put it back in after fermentation.

He was sorry for what he had doneâreally and truly sorry. If theyâd
only give him one more chance, heâd make good. Just one more chance.
Heâd work things out.

Heâd promised himself that both times theyâd put him up before, but
things had been different then. He hadnât really been given another
chance, what with parole boards and all.

Clayton closed his eyes and finished the beer. He ordered another.

Heâd worked in the mines for fifteen years. It wasnât that he minded
work really, but the foreman had it in for him. Always giving him a bad
time; always picking out the lousy jobs for him.

Like the time heâd crawled into a side-boring in Tunnel 12 for a nap
during lunch and the foreman had caught him. When he promised never to
do it again if the foreman wouldnât put it on report, the guy said,
âYeah. Sure. Hate to hurt a guyâs record.â

Then heâd put Clayton on report anyway. Strictly a rat.

Not that Clayton ran any chance of being fired; they never fired
anybody. But theyâd fined him a dayâs pay. A whole dayâs pay.

He tapped his glass on the bar, and the barman came over with another
beer. Clayton looked at it, then up at the barman. âPut a head on it.â

The bartender looked at him sourly. âIâve got some soapsuds here,
Clayton, and one of these days Iâm gonna put some in your beer if you
keep pulling that gag.â

That was the trouble with some guys. No sense of humor.

Somebody came in the door and then somebody else came in behind him, so
that both inner and outer doors were open for an instant. A blast of
icy breeze struck Claytonâs back, and he shivered. He started to say
something, then changed his mind; the doors were already closed again,
and besides, one of the guys was bigger than he was.

The iciness didnât seem to go away immediately. It was like the mine.
Little old Mars was cold clear down to her coreâor at least down as far
as theyâd drilled. The walls were frozen and seemed to radiate a chill
that pulled the heat right out of your blood.

Somebody was playing _Green Hills_ again, damn them. Evidently all of
his own selections had run out earlier than heâd thought they would.

Hell! There was nothing to do here. He might as well go home.

âGimme another beer, Mac.â

Heâd go home as soon as he finished this one.

He stood there with his eyes closed, listening to the music and hating
Mars.

A voice next to him said: âIâll have a whiskey.â


The voice sounded as if the man had a bad cold, and Clayton turned
slowly to look at him. After all the sterilization they went through
before they left Earth, nobody on Mars ever had a cold, so there was
only one thing that would make a manâs voice sound like that.

Clayton was right. The fellow had an oxygen tube clamped firmly over
his nose. He was wearing the uniform of the Space Transport Service.

âJust get in on the ship?â Clayton asked conversationally.

The man nodded and grinned. âYeah. Four hours before we take off
again.â He poured down the whiskey. âSure cold out.â

Clayton agreed. âItâs always cold.â He watched enviously as the
spaceman ordered another whiskey.

Clayton couldnât afford whiskey. He probably could have by this time,
if the mines had made him a foreman, like they should have.

Maybe he could talk the spaceman out of a couple of drinks.

âMy nameâs Clayton. Ron Clayton.â

The spaceman took the offered hand. âMineâs Parkinson, but everybody
calls me Parks.â

âSure, Parks. Uhâcan I buy you a beer?â

Parks shook his head. âNo, thanks. I started on whiskey. Here, let me
buy you one.â

âWellâthanks. Donât mind if I do.â

They drank them in silence, and Parks ordered two more.

âBeen here long?â Parks asked.

âFifteen years. Fifteen long, long years.â

âDid youâuhâI meanââ Parks looked suddenly confused.

Clayton glanced quickly to make sure the bartender was out of earshot.
Then he grinned. âYou mean am I a convict? Nah. I came here because I
wanted to. Butââ He lowered his voice. ââwe donât talk about it around
here. You know.â He gestured with one handâa gesture that took in
everyone else in the room.

Parks glanced around quickly, moving only his eyes. âYeah. I see,â he
said softly.

âThis your first trip?â asked Clayton.

âFirst one to Mars. Been on the Luna run a long time.â

âLow pressure bother you much?â

âNot much. We only keep it at six pounds in the ships. Half helium and
half oxygen. Only thing that bothers me is the oxy here. Or rather, the
oxy that _isnât_ here.â He took a deep breath through his nose tube to
emphasize his point.

Clayton clamped his teeth together, making the muscles at the side of
his jaw stand out.

Parks didnât notice. âYou guys have to take those pills, donât you?â

âYeah.â

âI had to take them once. Got stranded on Luna. The cat I was in broke
down eighty some miles from Aristarchus Base and I had to walk
backâwith my oxy low. Well, I figuredââ


Clayton listened to Parksâ story with a great show of attention, but he
had heard it before. This âlost on the moonâ stuff and its variations
had been going the rounds for forty years. Every once in a while, it
actually did happen to someone; just often enough to keep the story
going.

This guy did have a couple of new twists, but not enough to make the
story worthwhile.

âBoy,â Clayton said when Parks had finished, âyou were lucky to come
out of that alive!â

Parks nodded, well pleased with himself, and bought another round of
drinks.

âSomething like that happened to me a couple of years ago,â Clayton
began. âIâm supervisor on the third shift in the mines at Xanthe, but
at the time, I was only a foreman. One day, a couple of guys went to a
branch tunnel toââ

It was a very good story. Clayton had made it up himself, so he knew
that Parks had never heard it before. It was gory in just the right
places, with a nice effect at the end.

ââso I had to hold up the rocks with my back while the rescue crew
pulled the others out of the tunnel by crawling between my legs.
Finally, they got some steel beams down there to take the load off, and
I could let go. I was in the hospital for a week,â he finished.

Parks was nodding vaguely. Clayton looked up at the clock above the bar
and realized that they had been talking for better than an hour. Parks
was buying another round.

Parks was a hell of a nice fellow.

There was, Clayton found, only one trouble with Parks. He got to
talking so loud that the bartender refused to serve either one of them
any more.


The bartender said Clayton was getting loud, too, but it was just
because he had to talk loud to make Parks hear him.

Clayton helped Parks put his mask and parka on and they walked out into
the cold night.

Parks began to sing _Green Hills_. About halfway through, he stopped
and turned to Clayton.

âIâm from Indiana.â

Clayton had already spotted him as an American by his accent.

âIndiana? Thatâs nice. Real nice.â

âYeah. You talk about green hills, we got green hills in Indiana. What
time is it?â

Clayton told him.

âJeez-krise! Olâ spaship takes off in an hour. Ought to have one more
drink first.â

Clayton realized he didnât like Parks. But maybe heâd buy a bottle.

Sharkie Johnson worked in Fuels Section, and he made a nice little
sideline of stealing alcohol, cutting it, and selling it. He thought it
was real funny to call it Martian Gin.

Clayton said: âLetâs go over to Sharkieâs. Sharkie will sell us a
bottle.â

âOkay,â said Parks. âWeâll get a bottle. Thatâs what we need: a
bottle.â

It was quite a walk to the Sharkâs place. It was so cold that even
Parks was beginning to sober up a little. He was laughing like hell
when Clayton started to sing.

âWeâre going over to the Sharkâs
To buy a jug of gin for Parks!
Hi ho, hi ho, hi ho!â

One thing about a few drinks; you didnât get so cold. You didnât feel
it too much, anyway.


The Shark still had his light on when they arrived. Clayton whispered
to Parks: âIâll go in. He knows me. He wouldnât sell it if you were
around. You got eight credits?â

âSure I got eight credits. Just a minute, and Iâll give you eight
credits.â He fished around for a minute inside his parka, and pulled
out his notecase. His gloved fingers were a little clumsy, but he
managed to get out a five and three ones and hand them to Clayton.

âYou wait out here,â Clayton said.

He went in through the outer door and knocked on the inner one. He
should have asked for ten credits. Sharkie only charged five, and that
would leave him three for himself. But he could have got tenâmaybe
more.

When he came out with the bottle, Parks was sitting on a rock,
shivering.

âJeez-krise!â he said. âItâs cold out here. Letâs get to someplace
where itâs warm.â

âSure. I got the bottle. Want a drink?â

Parks took the bottle, opened it, and took a good belt out of it.

âHooh!â he breathed. âPretty smooth.â

As Clayton drank, Parks said: âHey! I better get back to the field! I
know! We can go to the menâs room and finish the bottle before the ship
takes off! Isnât that a good idea? Itâs warm there.â

They started back down the street toward the spacefield.

âYep, Iâm from Indiana. Southern part, down around Bloomington,â Parks
said. âGimme the jug. Not Bloomington, IllinoisâBloomington, Indiana.
We really got green hills down there.â He drank, and handed the bottle
back to Clayton. âPers-nally, I donât see why anybodyâd stay on Mars.
Here yâare, practicâly on the equator in the middle of the summer, and
itâs colder than hell. Brrr!

âNow if you was smart, youâd go home, where itâs warm. Mars wasnât
built for people to live on, anyhow. I donât see how you stand it.â

That was when Clayton decided he really hated Parks.

And when Parks said: âWhy be dumb, friend? Whynât you go home?â Clayton
kicked him in the stomach, hard.

âAnd that, thatââ Clayton said as Parks doubled over.

He said it again as he kicked him in the head. And in the ribs. Parks
was gasping as he writhed on the ground, but he soon lay still.

Then Clayton saw why. Parksâ nose tube had come off when Claytonâs foot
struck his head.

Parks was breathing heavily, but he wasnât getting any oxygen.

That was when the Big Idea hit Ron Clayton. With a nosepiece on like
that, you couldnât tell who a man was. He took another drink from the
jug and then began to take Parksâ clothes off.

The uniform fit Clayton fine, and so did the nose mask. He dumped his
own clothing on top of Parksâ nearly nude body, adjusted the little
oxygen tank so that the gas would flow properly through the mask, took
the first deep breath of good air heâd had in fifteen years, and walked
toward the spacefield.


He went into the menâs room at the Port Building, took a drink, and
felt in the pockets of the uniform for Parksâ identification. He found
it and opened the booklet. It read:

PARKINSON, HERBERT J.
Steward 2nd Class, STS

Above it was a photo, and a set of fingerprints.

Clayton grinned. Theyâd never know it wasnât Parks getting on the ship.

Parks was a steward, too. A cookâs helper. That was good. If heâd been
a jetman or something like that, the crew might wonder why he wasnât on
duty at takeoff. But a steward was different.

Clayton sat for several minutes, looking through the booklet and
drinking from the bottle. He emptied it just before the warning sirens
keened through the thin air.

Clayton got up and went outside toward the ship.

âWake up! Hey, you! Wake up!â

Somebody was slapping his cheeks. Clayton opened his eyes and looked at
the blurred face over his own.

From a distance, another voice said: âWho is it?â

The blurred face said: âI donât know. He was asleep behind these cases.
I think heâs drunk.â

Clayton wasnât drunkâhe was sick. His head felt like hell. Where the
devil was he?

âGet up, bud. Come on, get up!â

Clayton pulled himself up by holding to the manâs arm. The effort made
him dizzy and nauseated.

The other man said: âTake him down to sick bay, Casey. Get some thiamin
into him.â

Clayton didnât struggle as they led him down to the sick bay. He was
trying to clear his head. Where was he? He must have been pretty drunk
last night.

He remembered meeting Parks. And getting thrown out by the bartender.
Then what?

Oh, yeah. Heâd gone to the Sharkâs for a bottle. From there on, it was
mostly gone. He remembered a fight or something, but that was all that
registered.

The medic in the sick bay fired two shots from a hypo-gun into both
arms, but Clayton ignored the slight sting.

âWhere am I?â

âReal original. Here, take these.â He handed Clayton a couple of
capsules, and gave him a glass of water to wash them down with.

When the water hit his stomach, there was an immediate reaction.

âOh, Christ!â the medic said. âGet a mop, somebody. Here, bud; heave
into this.â He put a basin on the table in front of Clayton.

It took them the better part of an hour to get Clayton awake enough to
realize what was going on and where he was. Even then, he was plenty
groggy.


It was the First Officer of the STS-52 who finally got the story
straight. As soon as Clayton was in condition, the medic and the
quartermaster officer who had found him took him up to the First
Officerâs compartment.

âI was checking through the stores this morning when I found this man.
He was asleep, dead drunk, behind the crates.â

âHe was drunk, all right,â supplied the medic. âI found this in his
pocket.â He flipped a booklet to the First Officer.

The First was a young man, not older than twenty-eight with
tough-looking gray eyes. He looked over the booklet.

âWhere did you get Parkinsonâs ID booklet? And his uniform?â

Clayton looked down at his clothes in wonder. âI donât know.â

âYou _donât know_? Thatâs a hell of an answer.â

âWell, I was drunk,â Clayton said defensively. âA man doesnât know what
heâs doing when heâs drunk.â He frowned in concentration. He knew heâd
have to think up some story.

âI kind of remember we made a bet. I bet him I could get on the ship.
SureâI remember, now. Thatâs what happened; I bet him I could get on
the ship and we traded clothes.â

âWhere is he now?â

âAt my place, sleeping it off, I guess.â

âWithout his oxy-mask?â

âOh, I gave him my oxidation pills for the mask.â

The First shook his head. âThat sounds like the kind of trick Parkinson
would pull, all right. Iâll have to write it up and turn you both in to
the authorities when we hit Earth.â He eyed Clayton. âWhatâs your
name?â

âCartwright. Sam Cartwright,â Clayton said without batting an eye.

âVolunteer or convicted colonist?â

âVolunteer.â

The First looked at him for a long moment, disbelief in his eyes.

It didnât matter. Volunteer or convict, there was no place Clayton
could go. From the officerâs viewpoint, he was as safely imprisoned in
the spaceship as he would be on Mars or a prison on Earth.


The First wrote in the log book, and then said: âWell, weâre one man
short in the kitchen. You wanted to take Parkinsonâs place; brother,
youâve got itâwithout pay.â He paused for a moment.

âYou know, of course,â he said judiciously, âthat youâll be shipped
back to Mars immediately. And youâll have to work out your passage both
waysâit will be deducted from your pay.â

Clayton nodded. âI know.â

âI donât know what else will happen. If thereâs a conviction, you may
lose your volunteer status on Mars. And there may be fines taken out of
your pay, too.

âWell, thatâs all, Cartwright. You can report to Kissman in the
kitchen.â

The First pressed a button on his desk and spoke into the intercom.
âWho was on duty at the airlock when the crew came aboard last night?
Send him up. I want to talk to him.â

Then the quartermaster officer led Clayton out the door and took him to
the kitchen.

The shipâs driver tubes were pushing it along at a steady five hundred
centimeters per second squared acceleration, pushing her steadily
closer to Earth with a little more than half a gravity of drive.


There wasnât much for Clayton to do, really. He helped to select the
foods that went into the automatics, and he cleaned them out after each
meal was cooked. Once every day, he had to partially dismantle them for
a really thorough going-over.

And all the time, he was thinking.

Parkinson must be dead; he knew that. That meant the Chamber. And even
if he wasnât, theyâd send Clayton back to Mars. Luckily, there was no
way for either planet to communicate with the ship; it was hard enough
to keep a beam trained on a planet without trying to hit such a
comparatively small thing as a ship.

But they would know about it on Earth by now. They would pick him up
the instant the ship landed. And the best he could hope for was a
return to Mars.

No, by God! He wouldnât go back to that frozen mud-ball! Heâd stay on
Earth, where it was warm and comfortable and a man could live where he
was meant to live. Where there was plenty of air to breathe and plenty
of water to drink. Where the beer tasted like beer and not like slop.
Earth. Good green hills, the like of which exists nowhere else.

Slowly, over the days, he evolved a plan. He watched and waited and
checked each little detail to make sure nothing would go wrong. It
_couldnât_ go wrong. He didnât want to die, and he didnât want to go
back to Mars.

Nobody on the ship liked him; they couldnât appreciate his position. He
hadnât done anything to them, but they just didnât like him. He didnât
know why; heâd _tried_ to get along with them. Well, if they didnât
like him, the hell with them.

If things worked out the way he figured, theyâd be damned sorry.

He was very clever about the whole plan. When turn-over came, he
pretended to get violently spacesick. That gave him an opportunity to
steal a bottle of chloral hydrate from the medicâs locker.

And, while he worked in the kitchen, he spent a great deal of time
sharpening a big carving knife.

Once, during his off time, he managed to disable one of the shipâs two
lifeboats. He was saving the other for himself.

The ship was eight hours out from Earth and still decelerating when
Clayton pulled his getaway.


It was surprisingly easy. He was supposed to be asleep when he sneaked
down to the drive compartment with the knife. He pushed open the door,
looked in, and grinned like an ape.

The Engineer and the two jetmen were out cold from the chloral hydrate
in the coffee from the kitchen.

Moving rapidly, he went to the spares locker and began methodically to
smash every replacement part for the drivers. Then he took three of the
signal bombs from the emergency kit, set them for five minutes, and
placed them around the driver circuits.

He looked at the three sleeping men. What if they woke up before the
bombs went off? He didnât want to kill them though. He wanted them to
know what had happened and who had done it.

He grinned. There was a way. He simply had to drag them outside and jam
the door lock. He took the key from the Engineer, inserted it, turned
it, and snapped off the head, leaving the body of the key still in the
lock. Nobody would unjam it in the next four minutes.

Then he began to run up the stairwell toward the good lifeboat.

He was panting and out of breath when he arrived, but no one had
stopped him. No one had even seen him.

He clambered into the lifeboat, made everything ready, and waited.

The signal bombs were not heavy charges; their main purposes was to
make a flare bright enough to be seen for thousands of miles in space.
Fluorine and magnesium made plenty of lightâand heat.

Quite suddenly, there was no gravity. He had felt nothing, but he knew
that the bombs had exploded. He punched the LAUNCH switch on the
control board of the lifeboat, and the little ship leaped out from the
side of the greater one.

Then he turned on the drive, set it at half a gee, and watched the
STS-52 drop behind him. It was no longer decelerating, so it would miss
Earth and drift on into space. On the other hand, the lifeship would
come down very neatly within a few hundred miles of the spaceport in
Utah, the destination of the STS-52.

Landing the lifeship would be the only difficult part of the maneuver,
but they were designed to be handled by beginners. Full instructions
were printed on the simplified control board.


Clayton studied them for a while, then set the alarm to waken him in
seven hours and dozed off to sleep.

He dreamed of Indiana. It was full of nice, green hills and leafy
woods, and Parkinson was inviting him over to his motherâs house for
chicken and whiskey. And all for free.

Beneath the dream was the calm assurance that they would never catch
him and send him back. When the STS-52 failed to show up, they would
think he had been lost with it. They would never look for him.

When the alarm rang, Earth was a mottled globe looming hugely beneath
the ship. Clayton watched the dials on the board, and began to follow
the instructions on the landing sheet.

He wasnât too good at it. The accelerometer climbed higher and higher,
and he felt as though he could hardly move his hands to the proper
switches.

He was less than fifteen feet off the ground when his hand slipped. The
ship, out of control, shifted, spun, and toppled over on its side,
smashing a great hole in the cabin.

Clayton shook his head and tried to stand up in the wreckage. He got to
his hands and knees, dizzy but unhurt, and took a deep breath of the
fresh air that was blowing in through the hole in the cabin.

It felt just like home.

Subject: Lifeship 2, STS-52
Attention Mr. P. D. Latimer

Dear Paul,

I have on hand the copies of your reports on the rescue of the men on
the disabled STS-52. It is fortunate that the Lunar radar stations
could compute their orbit.

The detailed official report will follow, but briefly, this is what
happened:

The lifeship landedâor, rather, crashedâseveral miles west of Cheyenne,
as you know, but it was impossible to find the man who was piloting it
until yesterday because of the weather.

He has been identified as Ronald Watkins Clayton, exiled to Mars
fifteen years ago.

Evidently, he didnât realize that fifteen years of Martian gravity had
so weakened his muscles that he could hardly walk under the pull of a
full Earth gee.

As it was, he could only crawl about a hundred yards from the wrecked
lifeship before he collapsed.

Well, I hope this clears up everything.

I hope youâre not getting the snow storms up there like weâve been
getting them.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
